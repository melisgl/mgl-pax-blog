The xmodmap files set up a Lisp machine like keyboard layout. The
quick summary is that it has parens and brackets swapped, backspace on
the capslock key and logically placed modifiers. There is nothing
mapped onto the old backspace key to ease migration :-).

There are two versions: one for pc105 with two win keys (my normal
keyboard) and one for pc105 with one win key (my laptop keyboard).

On pc105 with two win keys the modifier row looks like this:

  Super_L Meta_L/Alt_L Control_L Space Control_R Meta_R/Alt_R Super_R Hyper_R

On pc105 with only one win key you don't get the hyper key that's
useful provides quick access to the hungarian layout without actually
switching to it. Otherwise it's the same.

If you are touch typing press control with the thumb of your free
hand. In general you can always use your free hand for the modifiers
to reduce strain.

The xmodmap file cannot set the necessary repeatable flags, so use a
simple script like this:

  #!/bin/sh -x
  xmodmap ~/.lisp-machine-pc105-us.xmodmap
  # Backspace is repeatable.
  xset r 66
  # Caps_Lock is not.
  xset -r 22
