<p>For what has been a fun ride, the official results are now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110724100751/http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/contest/rankings.php" >available</a>.
In the end, 11th out of 700 is not too bad and it's the highest
ranking non-C++ entry by some margin.</p>

<p>I entered the contest a bit late with a rather specific approach in
mind: <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?UCT" >UCT</a>, an algorithm from the
Monte Carlo tree search family. It has been rather successful in
Go (and in Hex too, taking the crown from
<a href="hex/six/index.html" >Six</a>). So with UCT in mind, to serve as a
baseline, I implemented a quick
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" >minimax</a> with a simple
territory based evaluation function ... that everyone else in the
competition seems to have invented independently. Trouble was
looming because it was doing too well: with looking ahead only one
move (not even considering moves of the opponent), it played a very
nice positional game. That was the first sign that constructing a
good evaluation function may not be as hard for Tron as it is for
Go.</p>

<p>But with everyone else doing minimax, the plan was to keep silent
and Monte Carlo to victory. As with most plans, it didn't quite work
out. First, to my dismay, some contestants were attempting to do the
same and kept advertising it on <code>#googleai</code>, second it turned out
that UCT is not suited to the game of Tron. A totally random default
policy kept cornering itself in a big area faster than another
player could hit the wall at the end of a long dead end. That was
worrisome but fixable. After days of experimentation I finally gave
up on it deciding that Tron is simply too tactical – or not fuzzy
enough, if you prefer – for MC to work really well.</p>

<p>Of course, it can be that the kind of default policies I tried were
biased (a sure thing), misguided and suboptimal. But then again, I
was not alone and watched the UCT based players struggle badly. In
the final standings the highest ranking one is jmcarthur in position
105. One of them even implemented a number of different default
policies and switched between them randomly with little apparent
success. Which makes me think that including a virtual strategy
selection move at some points in the UCT search tree should be
interesting, but I digress.</p>

<p>So I went back to minimax, implemented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning" >alpha–beta
pruning</a> with
principal variation, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening" >iterative
deepening</a>. It
seemed to do really well on the then current maps whose size was
severely reduced to 15x15 to control the load on the servers. Then,
I had an idea to explore how the parities of squares in an area
affect the longest path possible, which was quickly pointed out to
me over lunch by a friend. And those pesky competitors have also
found and advertised it in the contest forum. Bah.</p>

<p>There were only two days left at this point, and I had to pull an
all nighter to finally implement a graph partitioning idea of mine
that unsurprisingly someone has described pretty closely in the
forum. At that point, I finally had the tool to improve the
evaluation function but neither much time or energy remained and I
settled for using it only in the end game when the players are
separated.</p>

<p>The code itself is as ugly as exploratory code can be, but in the
coming days, I'll factor the UCT and the alpha–beta code out.</p>
