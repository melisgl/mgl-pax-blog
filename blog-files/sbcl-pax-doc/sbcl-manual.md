###### \[in package SB-MANUAL\]
This is an unofficial rendering of the SBCL Manual
using MGL-PAX with the same content as the
official version at <https://www.sbcl.org/> but with heavy linking
internally, to the `clhs`, and to the source code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/sbcl/sbcl).

The output is for SBCL version `2.6.5.73.pax-doc.20-da4135755`, generated *2026-06-27 11:59:54*. See

This manual is part of the SBCL software system. See the
`README` file for more information. The manual is largely
derived from the manual for the [CMUCL](https://cmucl.org/) system,
which was produced at Carnegie Mellon University and later released
into the public domain. The manual is in the public domain and is

## 1 Getting Support and Reporting Bugs

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40VOLUNTEER-SUPPORT-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 1.1 Volunteer Support

Your primary source of SBCL support should probably be the mailing
list `sbcl-help`: in addition to other users SBCL developers monitor
this list and are available for advice. As an anti-spam measure
subscription is required for posting:

<https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sbcl-help>

Remember that the people answering your question are volunteers, so
you stand a much better chance of getting a good answer if you ask a
good question.

Before sending mail, check the list archives at either

<http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=sbcl-help>

or

<http://news.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.steel-bank.general>

to see if your question has been answered already. Checking the bug
database is also worth it (see [Reporting Bugs][e7b2]), to see if the issue
is already known.

For general advice on asking good questions, see

<http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html>.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40COMMERCIAL-SUPPORT-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 1.2 Commercial Support

There is no formal organization developing SBCL, but if you need a
paid support arrangement or custom SBCL development, we maintain the
list of companies and consultants below. Use it to identify service
providers with appropriate skills and interests, and contact them
directly.

The SBCL project cannot verify the accuracy of the information or
the competence of the people listed, and they have provided their
own blurbs below: you must make your own judgement of suitability
from the available information - refer to the links they provide,
the CREDITS file, mailing list archives, CVS commit messages, and so
on. Please feel free to ask for advice on the sbcl-help list.

(At present, no companies or consultants wish to advertise paid
support or custom SBCL development in this manual).

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40REPORTING-BUGS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 1.3 Reporting Bugs

SBCL uses Launchpad to track bugs. The bug database is available at

<https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl>

Reporting bugs there requires registering at Launchpad. However,
bugs can also be reported on the mailing list `sbcl-bugs`,
which is moderated but does *not* require subscribing.

Simply send email to `sbcl-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net` and the bug
will be checked and added to Launchpad by SBCL maintainers.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40HOW-TO-REPORT-BUGS-EFFECTIVELY-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 1.3.1 How to Report Bugs Effectively

Please include enough information in a bug report that someone reading
it can reproduce the problem, i.e. don't write

    Subject: apparent bug in PRINT-OBJECT (or *PRINT-LENGTH*?)
    PRINT-OBJECT doesn't seem to work with *PRINT-LENGTH*. Is this a bug?

but instead

    Subject: apparent bug in PRINT-OBJECT (or *PRINT-LENGTH*?)
    In sbcl-1.2.3 running under OpenBSD 4.5 on my Alpha box, when
    I compile and load the file
       (DEFSTRUCT (FOO (:PRINT-OBJECT (LAMBDA (X Y)
                                        (LET ((*PRINT-LENGTH* 4))
                                          (PRINT X Y)))))
         X Y)
    then at the command line type
       (MAKE-FOO)
    the program loops endlessly instead of printing the object.

A more in-depth discussion on reporting bugs effectively can be
found at

<http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html>.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40HOW-TO-REPORT-SIGNAL-RELATED-BUGS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 1.3.2 How to Report Signal-related Bugs

If you run into a signal related bug, you are getting fatal errors
such as `signal N is [un]blocked` or just hangs, and you want to
send a useful bug report then:

- Compile SBCL with `ldb` enabled (feature `:sb-ldb`, see
  `base-target-features.lisp-expr`).

- Isolate a smallish test case, run it.

- If it just hangs kill it with `sigabrt`: `kill -ABRT <pidof sbcl>`.

- Print the backtrace from ldb by typing `ba`.

- Attach gdb: `gdb -p <pidof sbcl>` and get backtraces for all
  threads: `thread apply all ba`.

- If multiple threads are in play then still in gdb, try to get Lisp
  backtrace for all threads: `thread apply all call
  backtrace_from_fp($ebp, 100, 0)`. Substitute `$ebp` with `$rbp` on
  x86-64. The backtraces will appear in the stdout of the SBCL
  process.

- Send a report with the backtraces and the output (both stdout and
  stderr) produced by SBCL.

- Don't forget to include OS and SBCL version.

- If available, include information on outcome of the same test with
  other versions of SBCL, OS, ...


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40INTRODUCTION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

## 2 Introduction

SBCL is a mostly-conforming implementation of the ANSI Common Lisp
standard. This manual focuses on behavior which is specific to SBCL,
not on behavior which is common to all implementations of ANSI Common
Lisp.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40ANSI-CONFORMANCE-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 2.1 ANSI Conformance

Essentially every type of non-conformance is considered a bug. (The
exceptions involve internal inconsistencies in the standard.) See
[Reporting Bugs][e7b2].

- [`prog2`][3002] returns the primary value of its second form, as
  specified in the *Arguments and Values* section of the
  specification for that operator, not that of its first form, as
  specified in the *Description*.

- The [`string`][b93c] type is considered to be the union of all types
  `(array c (size))` for all non-`nil` subtypes `c` of
   [`character`][32e3], excluding arrays specialized to the empty
   type.

- The `:order` long form option in [`define-method-combination`][006c] method
  group specifiers accepts the value `nil` as well as
  `:most-specific-first` and `:most-specific-last`, in order to allow
  programmers to declare that the order of methods playing that role
  in the method combination does not matter.

### 2.2 Extensions

SBCL comes with numerous extensions, some in core and some in modules
loadable with [`require`][360d]. Unfortunately, not all of these extensions
have proper documentation yet.

- **System Definition Tool:** ASDF is a flexible and popular
  protocol-oriented system definition tool by Daniel Barlow.

- **Foreign Function Interface:** The `sb-alien` package allows
  interfacing with C-code, loading shared object files, etc. See
  [Foreign Function Interface][4be1].

    [sb-grovel][6bfb] can be used to partially automate generation of
    foreign function interface definitions.

- **Recursive Event Loop:** SBCL provides a recursive event
  loop (`serve-event`) for doing non-blocking IO on multiple streams
  without using threads.

- **Timeouts and Deadlines:** SBCL allows restricting the execution
  time of individual operations or parts of a computation using
  `:timeout` arguments to certain blocking operations, synchronous
  timeouts and asynchronous timeouts. The latter two affect operations
  without explicit timeout support (such as standard functions and
  macros). See [Timeouts and Deadlines][f53d].

- **Metaobject Protocol:** The `sb-mop` package provides an
  implementation of the metaobject protocol for the Common Lisp
  Object System as described in *The Art of the Metaobject Protocol*
  by Kiczales et al.

- **Extensible Sequences:** SBCL allows users to define subclasses
  of the [`sequence`][ae23] class. See [Extensible Sequences][5f65].

- **Native Threads:** SBCL has native threads on numerous platforms,
  capable of taking advantage of SMP on multiprocessor machines. See
  [Threading][6ec7].

- **Network Interface:** The `sb-bsd-sockets` module is a low-level
  networking interface, providing both TCP and UDP sockets. See
  [Networking][a9ee].

- **Introspective Facilities:** The [sb-introspect][f942] module offers
  numerous introspective extensions, including access to function
  lambda-lists and a cross referencing facility.

- **Operating System Interface:** The `sb-ext` package contains a
  number of functions for running external processes, accessing
  environment variables, etc.

    The [sb-posix][3ddd] module provides a lispy interface to standard
    POSIX facilities.

- **Extensible Streams:** The package `sb-gray` provides an
  implementation of [Gray Streams][5165].

    The [Simple Streams][c2e4] module is an implementation of the Simple
    Streams API proposed by Franz Inc.

- **Profiling:** The `sb-profile` package provides an exact,
  per-function [Deterministic Profiler][4e78].

    The `sb-sprof` module is SBCL's [Statistical Profiler][db7a], capable
    of call-graph generation and instruction level profiling, which
    also supports allocation profiling.

- **Customization Hooks:** SBCL contains a number of extra-standard
  customization hooks that can be used to tweak the behaviour of the
  system. See [Customization Hooks for Users][b192].

- **sb-aclrepl:** The [sb-aclrepl][bb66] module provides an Allegro-style
  toplevel for SBCL, as an alternative to the classic CMUCL-style
  one.

- **CLTL2 Compatibility Layer:** The SB-CLTL2 module provides
  `sb-cltl2:compiler-let` and environment access functionality
  described in *Common Lisp The Language, 2nd Edition* which were
  removed from the language during the ANSI standardization process.

- **Executable Delivery:** The `:executable` argument to
  [`sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die`][9e55] can produce a "standalone" executable
  containing both an image of the current Lisp session and an SBCL
  runtime.

- **Bitwise Rotation:** The [sb-rotate-byte][0da4] module provides an
  efficient primitive for bitwise rotation of integers, an operation
  required by e.g. numerous cryptographic algorithms but not
  available as a primitive in ANSI Common Lisp.

- **Test Harness:** The `sb-rt` module is a simple yet attractive
  regression and unit-test framework.

- **MD5 Sums:** The [sb-md5][4321] module provides an implementation of the
  MD5 message digest algorithm for Common Lisp, using the
  [Modular Arithmetic][1a1b] optimizations provided by SBCL.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40IDIOSYNCRASIES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 2.3 Idiosyncrasies

The information in this section describes some of the ways that SBCL
deals with choices that the ANSI standard leaves to the
implementation.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DECLARATIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 2.3.1 Declarations

Declarations are generally treated as assertions. This general
principle, and its implications, and the bugs which still keep the
compiler from quite satisfying this principle, are discussed in
[Declarations as Assertions][5848].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40FASL-FORMAT-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 2.3.2 FASL format

SBCL fasl-format is binary compatible only with the exact SBCL version
it was generated with. While this is obviously suboptimal, it has
proven more robust than trying to maintain fasl compatibility across
versions: accidentally breaking things is far too easy, and can lead
to hard to diagnose bugs.

The following snippet handles fasl recompilation automatically for
ASDF-based systems, and makes a good candidate for inclusion in the
user or system initialization file (see [Initialization Files][1016]).

    (require :asdf)
    
    ;;; If a fasl was stale, try to recompile and load (once).
    (defmethod asdf:perform :around ((o asdf:load-op)
                                     (c asdf:cl-source-file))
       (handler-case (call-next-method o c)
          ;; If a fasl was stale, try to recompile and load (once).
          (sb-ext:invalid-fasl ()
             (asdf:perform (make-instance 'asdf:compile-op) c)
             (call-next-method))))


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40COMPILER-ONLY-IMPLEMENTATION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 2.3.3 Compiler-only Implementation

SBCL is essentially a compiler-only implementation of Common Lisp.
That is, for all but a few special cases, [`eval`][0d6e] creates a lambda
expression, calls [`compile`][bc41] on the lambda expression to create a
compiled function, and then calls [`funcall`][03c7] on the resulting function
object. A more traditional interpreter is also available on default
builds; it is usually only called internally. This is explicitly
allowed by the ANSI standard but leads to some oddities; e.g. at
default settings, [`functionp`][6f91] and [`compiled-function-p`][10e5] are equivalent,
and they collapse into the same function when SBCL is built without
the interpreter.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DEFINING-CONSTANTS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 2.3.4 Defining Constants

SBCL is quite strict about ANSI's definition of [`defconstant`][8934].
ANSI says that doing `defconstant` of the same symbol more than once
is undefined unless the new value is [`eql`][38a2] to the old value.
Conforming to this specification is a nuisance when the "constant"
value is only constant under some weaker test like [`string=`][4143] or [`equal`][3fb5].

It's especially annoying because, in SBCL, `defconstant` takes effect
not only at load time but also at compile time, so that just
compiling and loading reasonable code like

    (defconstant +foobyte+ '(1 4))

runs into this undefined behavior. Many implementations of Common
Lisp try to help the programmer around this annoyance by silently
accepting the undefined code and trying to do what the programmer
probably meant.

SBCL instead treats the undefined behavior as an error. Often such
code can be rewritten in portable ANSI Common Lisp which has the
desired behavior. E.g., the code above can be given an exactly
defined meaning by replacing `defconstant` either with [`defparameter`][570e] or
with a customized macro which does the right thing, e.g.

    (defmacro define-constant (name value &optional doc)
      `(defconstant ,name (if (boundp ',name) (symbol-value ',name) ,value)
                          ,@(when doc (list doc))))

or possibly along the lines of the `sb-int:defconstant-eqx` macro used
internally in the implementation of SBCL itself. In circumstances
where this is not appropriate, the programmer can handle the
condition type `sb-ext:defconstant-uneql` and choose either the
[`continue`][1867] restart or [`abort`][ae44] restart as appropriate.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40STYLE-WARNINGS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 2.3.5 Style Warnings

SBCL gives style warnings about various kinds of perfectly legal code,
e.g.

- multiple [`defun`][f472]s of the same symbol in different units;

- special variables not named in the conventional `*foo*` style, and
  lexical variables unconventionally named in the `*foo*` style.

This causes friction with people who point out that other ways of
organizing code (especially avoiding the use of [`defgeneric`][c7f7]) are just
as aesthetically stylish. However, these warnings should be read not
as *warning, bad aesthetics detected, you have no style* but as
*warning, this style keeps the compiler from understanding the code
as well as you might like*. That is, unless the compiler warns about
such conditions, there's no way for the compiler to warn about some
programming errors which would otherwise be easy to
overlook. (Related bug: The warning about multiple `defun`s is
pointlessly annoying when you compile and then load a function
containing `defun` wrapped in [`eval-when`][9c9c], and ideally should be
suppressed in that case, but still isn't as of SBCL 0.7.6.)

### 2.4 Development Tools

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40EDITOR-INTEGRATION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 2.4.1 Editor Integration

Though SBCL can be used running "bare", the recommended mode of
development is with an editor connected to SBCL, supporting not
only basic lisp editing (paren-matching, etc), but providing among
other features an integrated debugger, interactive compilation, and
automated documentation lookup.

Currently *SLIME* (Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs)
together with Emacs is recommended for use with SBCL, though other
options exist as well. Historically, the ILISP package at
<http://ilisp.cons.org/> provided similar functionality, but it does
not support modern SBCL versions.

SLIME can be downloaded from <https://slime.common-lisp.dev/>.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40LANGUAGE-REFERENCE-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 2.4.2 Language Reference

*CLHS* (Common Lisp Hyperspec) is a hypertext version of the ANSI
standard, made freely available by LispWorks -- an invaluable
reference.

See <https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm>.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40GENERATING-EXECUTABLES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 2.4.3 Generating Executables

SBCL can generate stand-alone executables. The generated executables
include the SBCL runtime itself, so no restrictions are placed on
program functionality. For example, a deployed program can call
[`compile`][bc41] and [`load`][b5ec], which requires the compiler to be present in the
executable. For further information, [`sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die`][9e55].

### 2.5 More SBCL Information

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SBCL-HOMEPAGE-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 2.5.1 SBCL Homepage

The SBCL website at <http://www.sbcl.org/> has some general
information, plus links to mailing lists devoted to SBCL, and to
archives of these mailing lists. Subscribing to the mailing lists
`sbcl-help` and `sbcl-announce` is recommended: both are fairly
low-volume, and help you keep abreast with SBCL development.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40ONLINE-DOCUMENTATION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 2.5.2 Online Documentation

Documentation for non-ANSI extensions for various commands is
available online from the SBCL executable itself. The extensions for
functions which have their own command prompts (e.g. the debugger,
and [`inspect`][a485]) are documented in text available by typing `help` at
their command prompts. The extensions for functions which don't have
their own command prompt (such as [`trace`][548d]) are described in their
documentation strings, unless your SBCL was compiled with an option
not to include documentation strings, in which case the
documentation strings are only readable in the source code.

#### 2.6.3 Common Lisp Books

If you're not a programmer and you're trying to learn, many
introductory Lisp books are available. However, we don't have any
standout favorites.

If you are an experienced programmer in other languages but need to
learn about Common Lisp, some books stand out:

- Practical Common Lisp, by Peter Seibel

    An excellent introduction to the language, covering both the
    basics and "advanced topics" like macros, CLOS, and packages.
    Available both in print format and on the web:
    <https://gigamonkeys.com/book/>.

- Paradigms Of Artificial Intelligence Programming, by Peter Norvig

    Good information on general Common Lisp programming, and many
    nontrivial examples. Whether or not your work is AI, it's a very
    good book to look at.

- On Lisp, by Paul Graham

    An in-depth treatment of macros, but not recommended as a first
    Common Lisp book, since it is slightly pre-ANSI so you need to
    be on your guard against non-standard usages, and since it
    doesn't really even try to cover the language as a whole,
    focusing solely on macros. Downloadable from
    <https://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html>.

- Object-Oriented Programming In Common Lisp, by Sonya Keene

    With the exception of *Practical Common Lisp*, most introductory
    books don't emphasize CLOS. This one does. Even if you're very
    knowledgeable about object oriented programming in the abstract,
    it's worth looking at this book if you want to do any OO in
    Common Lisp. Some abstractions in CLOS (especially multiple
    dispatch) go beyond anything you'll see in most OO systems, and
    there are a number of lesser differences as well. This book
    tends to help with the culture shock.

- Art Of Metaobject Programming, by Gregor Kiczales et al.

    Currently the prime source of information on the Common Lisp
    Metaobject Protocol, which is supported by SBCL. Section
    2 (Chapters 5 and 6) are freely available at
    <http://mop.lisp.se/www.alu.org/mop/>.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40HISTORY-AND-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-SBCL-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 2.7 History and Implementation of SBCL

You can work productively with SBCL without knowing or understanding
anything about where it came from, how it is implemented, or how it
extends the ANSI Common Lisp standard. However, a little knowledge
can be helpful in order to understand error messages, to
troubleshoot problems, to understand why some parts of the system
are better debugged than others, and to anticipate which known bugs,
known performance problems, and missing extensions are likely to be
fixed, tuned, or added.

SBCL is descended from CMUCL, which is itself descended from Spice
Lisp, including early implementations for the Mach operating system on
the IBM RT, back in the 1980s. Some design decisions from that time are
still reflected in the current implementation:

- The system expects to be loaded into a fixed-at-compile-time
  location in virtual memory, and also expects the location of all
  of its heap storage to be specified at compile time.

- The system overcommits memory, allocating large amounts of address
  space from the system (often more than the amount of virtual
  memory available) and then failing if it ends up using too much of
  the allocated storage.

- The system is implemented as a C program which is responsible for
  supplying low-level services and loading a Lisp `.core` file.

SBCL also inherited some newer architectural features from CMUCL.
The most important is that on some architectures it has a
generational GC, which has various implications (mostly good) for
performance. These are discussed in another chapter, [Efficiency][29fd].

SBCL has diverged from CMUCL in that SBCL is now essentially a
compiler-only implementation of Common Lisp. This is a change in
implementation strategy, taking advantage of the freedom "any of
these facilities might share the same execution strategy"
guaranteed in `clhs` [`3.1`][2c92] (Evaluation). It does not mean SBCL can't
be used interactively, and in fact the change is largely invisible
to the casual user, since SBCL still can and does execute code
interactively by compiling it on the fly. (It is visible if you know
how to look, like using [`compiled-function-p`][10e5]; and it is visible in
the way that SBCL doesn't have many bugs which behave differently in
interpreted code than in compiled code.) What it means is that in
SBCL, the [`eval`][0d6e] function only truly "interprets" a few easy kinds
of forms, such as symbols which are [`boundp`][6c37]. More complicated forms
are evaluated by calling [`compile`][bc41] and then calling [`funcall`][03c7] on the
returned result.

The direct ancestor of SBCL is the x86 port of CMUCL. This port was in
some ways the most cobbled-together of all the CMUCL ports, since a
number of strange changes had to be made to support the register-poor
x86 architecture. Some things (like tracing and debugging) do not work
particularly well there. SBCL should be able to improve in these areas
(and has already improved in some other areas), but it takes a while.

On the x86 SBCL -- like the x86 port of CMUCL -- uses a
\_@CONSERVATIVE-GC. This means that it doesn't maintain a strict
separation between tagged and untagged data, instead treating some
untagged data (e.g. raw floating point numbers) as possibly-tagged
data and so not collecting any Lisp objects that they point to. This
has some negative consequences for average time efficiency (though
possibly no worse than the negative consequences of trying to
implement an exact GC on a processor architecture as register-poor
as the X86) and also has potentially unlimited consequences for
worst-case memory efficiency. In practice, conservative GCs work
reasonably well, not getting anywhere near the worst case. But they
can occasionally cause odd patterns of memory usage.

The fork from CMUCL was based on a major rewrite of the system
bootstrap process. CMUCL has for many years tolerated a very unusual
"build" procedure which doesn't actually build the complete system
from scratch, but instead progressively overwrites parts of a
running system with new versions. This quasi-build procedure can
cause various bizarre bootstrapping hangups, especially when a major
change is made to the system. It also makes the connection between
the current source code and the current executable more tenuous than
in other software systems -- it's easy to accidentally build a CMUCL
system containing characteristics not reflected in the current
version of the source code.

Other major changes since the fork from CMUCL include:

- SBCL has removed many CMUCL extensions, (e.g. IP networking,
  remote procedure call, Unix system interface, and X11 interface)
  from the core system. Most of these are available as contributed
  modules (distributed with SBCL) or third-party modules instead.

- SBCL has deleted or deprecated some nonstandard features and code
  complexity which helped efficiency at the price of
  maintainability. For example, the SBCL compiler no longer
  implements memory pooling internally (and so is simpler and more
  maintainable, but generates more garbage and runs more slowly).

## 3 Starting and Stopping

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40STARTING-SBCL-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 3.1 Starting SBCL

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40RUNNING-FROM-SHELL-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 3.1.1 Running from Shell

To run SBCL, type `sbcl` at the command line.

You should end up in the toplevel *REPL* (read-eval-print loop),
where you can interact with SBCL by typing expressions.

    $ sbcl
    This is SBCL 0.8.13.60, an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.
    More information about SBCL is available at <http://www.sbcl.org/>.
    
    SBCL is free software, provided as is, with absolutely no warranty.
    It is mostly in the public domain; some portions are provided under
    BSD-style licenses.  See the CREDITS and COPYING files in the
    distribution for more information.
    * (+ 2 2)
    4
    * (exit)
    $

Also see [Command Line Options][1294] and [Stopping SBCL][a9a5].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40RUNNING-FROM-EMACS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 3.1.2 Running from Emacs

To run SBCL as an `inferior-lisp` from Emacs, in your `.emacs` do
something like:

    ;;; The SBCL binary and command-line arguments
    (setq inferior-lisp-program "/usr/local/bin/sbcl --noinform")

For more information on using SBCL with Emacs, see
[Editor Integration][07b6].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SHEBANG-SCRIPTS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 3.1.3 Shebang Scripts

Standard Unix tools that are interpreters follow a common command line
protocol that is necessary to work with "shebang scripts". SBCL
supports this via the `--script` command line option (see
[Command Line Options][1294]).

Example file (`hello.lisp`):

    #!/usr/local/bin/sbcl --script
    (write-line "Hello, World!")

Usage from the command line:

    $ ./hello.lisp
    Hello, World!

Note that SBCL skips the shebang line when it reads the file:

    $ sbcl --script hello.lisp
    Hello, World!


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40STOPPING-SBCL-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 3.2 Stopping SBCL

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40EXIT-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 3.2.1 Exit

SBCL can be stopped at any time by calling [`sb-ext:exit`][7f27],
optionally returning a specified numeric value to the calling
process. See [Threading][6ec7] for information about terminating individual
threads.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AEXIT-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:exit** *&key code abort (timeout \*exit-timeout\*)*

    Terminates the process, causing SBCL to exit with `code`. `code`
    defaults to 0 when `abort` is false, and 1 when it is true.
    
    When `abort` is false (the default), current thread is first unwound,
    [`*exit-hooks*`][9ac6] are run, other threads are terminated, and standard
    output streams are flushed before SBCL calls `exit(3)` -- at which point
    `atexit(3)` functions will run. If multiple threads call `exit` with `abort`
    being false, the first one to call it will complete the protocol.
    
    When `abort` is true, SBCL exits immediately by calling `_exit(2)`
    without unwinding stack, or calling exit hooks. Note that `_exit(2)`
    does not call `atexit(3)` functions unlike `exit(3)`.
    
    Recursive calls to `exit` cause `exit` to behave as if `abort` was true.
    
    `timeout` controls waiting for other threads to terminate when `abort` is
    `nil`. Once current thread has been unwound and `*exit-hooks*` have been
    run, spawning new threads is prevented and all other threads are
    terminated by calling [`sb-thread:terminate-thread`][4d23] on them. The system
    then waits for them to finish using [`sb-thread:join-thread`][bcf9], waiting at
    most a total `timeout` seconds for all threads to join. Those threads
    that do not finish in time are simply ignored while the exit protocol
    continues. `timeout` defaults to `*exit-timeout*`, which in turn defaults
    to 60. `timeout` `nil` means to wait indefinitely.
    
    Note that `timeout` applies only to `sb-thread:join-thread`, not
    `*exit-hooks*`. Since `sb-thread:terminate-thread` is asynchronous,
    getting multithreaded application termination with complex cleanups
    right using it can be tricky. To perform an orderly synchronous
    shutdown use an exit hook instead of relying on implicit thread
    termination.
    
    Consequences are unspecified if serious conditions occur during `exit`
    excepting errors from `*exit-hooks*`, which cause warnings and stop
    execution of the hook that signaled, but otherwise allow the exit
    process to continue normally.

#### 3.2.2 End of File

By default SBCL also exits on end of input, caused either by user
pressing `Control-D` on an attached terminal, or end of input when
using SBCL as part of a shell pipeline.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SAVING-A-CORE-IMAGE-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 3.2.3 Saving a Core Image

SBCL has the ability to save its state as a file for later
execution. This functionality is important for its bootstrapping
process, and is also provided as an extension to the user.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ASAVE-LISP-AND-DIE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die** *core-file-name &key (toplevel \#'toplevel-init) executable save-runtime-options callable-exports (purify t) root-structures (environment-name "auxiliary") compression*

    Save a "core image", i.e. enough information to restart a Lisp
    process later in the same state, in the file of the specified name.
    Only global state is preserved: the stack is unwound in the process.
    
    The following [`&key`][4336] arguments are defined:
    
    - `:toplevel`
    
        The function to run when the created core file is resumed. The
        default function handles command line toplevel option
        processing (see [Toplevel Options][6be4]) and runs the top
        level read-eval-print loop. This function returning is equivalent
        to ([`sb-ext:exit`][7f27] `:code` 0) being called.
    
        `toplevel` functions should always provide an [`abort`][ae44] restart:
        otherwise code they call will run without one.
    
    - `:executable`
    
        If true, arrange to combine the SBCL runtime and the core image to
        create a standalone executable. If false (the default), the core
        image will not be executable on its own. Executable images always
        behave as if they were passed the `--noinform` runtime option.
         If `:executable` is `:elf-object`, then the resulting core will be
         wrapped in a .o which requires further linking. (EXPERIMENTAL)
    
    - `:save-runtime-options`
    
        If true, values of runtime options `--dynamic-space-size` and
        `--control-stack-size` that were used to start SBCL are stored in
        the standalone executable, and restored when the executable is
        run. This also inhibits normal runtime option processing, causing
        all command line arguments to be passed to the toplevel. If
        `:accept-runtime-options` then `--dynamic-space-size` and
        `--control-stack-size` are still processed by the runtime.
        Meaningless if `:executable` is `nil`.
    
    - `:callable-exports`
    
        This should be a list of symbols to be initialized to the
        appropriate alien callables on startup. All exported symbols
        should be present as global symbols in the symbol table of the
        runtime before the saved core is loaded. When this list is
        non-empty, the `:toplevel` argument cannot be supplied.
    
    - `:purify`
    
        If true (the default), then some objects in the restarted core
        will be memory-mapped as read-only. Among those objects are
        numeric vectors that were determined to be compile-time constants,
        and any immutable values according to the language specification
        such as symbol names.
    
    - `:root-structures`
    
        This should be a list of the main entry points in any newly loaded
        systems. This need not be supplied, but locality and/or [`gc`][b50b]
        performance may be better if they are. This has two different but
        related meanings: If `:purify` is true - and only for cheneygc - the
        root structures are those which anchor the set of objects moved
        into static space. On gencgc - and only on platforms supporting
        immobile code - these are the functions and/or function-names
        which commence a depth-first scan of code when reordering based on
        the statically observable call chain. The complete set of
        reachable objects is not affected per se. This argument is
        meaningless if neither enabling precondition holds.
    
    - `:environment-name`
    
        This has no purpose; it is accepted only for legacy compatibility.
    
    - `:compression`
    
        This is only meaningful if the runtime was built with the
        `:sb-core-compression` feature enabled. If `nil` (the default),
        saves to uncompressed core files. If `:sb-core-compression` was
        enabled at build-time, the argument may also be an integer from -7
        to 22, corresponding to zstd compression levels, or `t` (which is
        equivalent to the default compression level, 9).
    
    - `:application-type`
    
        Present only on Windows and is meaningful only with `:executable` `t`.
        Specifies the subsystem of the executable, `:console` or `:gui`.
        The notable difference is that `:gui` doesn't automatically create
        a console window. The default is `:console`.
    
    The save/load process changes the values of some global variables:
    
    - [`*standard-output*`][e7ee], [`*debug-io*`][10ff], etc
    
        Everything related to open streams is necessarily changed, since
        the OS won't let us preserve a stream across save and load.
    
    - [`*default-pathname-defaults*`][752f]
    
        This is reinitialized to reflect the working directory where the
        saved core is loaded.
    
    `save-lisp-and-die` interacts with [`sb-alien:load-shared-object`][3c84]: see its
    documentation for details.
    
    On threaded platforms only a single thread may remain running after
    [`sb-ext:*save-hooks*`][bbf4] have run. Applications using multiple threads can
    be `save-lisp-and-die` friendly by registering a save-hook that quits
    any additional threads, and an init-hook that restarts them.
    
    This implementation is not as polished and painless as you might like:
    
    - It corrupts the current Lisp image enough that the current process
      needs to be killed afterwards. This can be worked around by forking
      another process that saves the core.
    
    - There is absolutely no binary compatibility of core images between
      different runtime support programs. Even runtimes built from the
      same sources at different times are treated as incompatible for this
      purpose.
    
    This isn't because we like it this way, but just because there don't
    seem to be good quick fixes for either limitation and no one has been
    sufficiently motivated to do lengthy fixes.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2ASAVE-HOOKS-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*save-hooks\*** *nil*

    A list of function designators which are called in an unspecified
    order before creating a saved core image.
    
    Unused by SBCL itself: reserved for user and applications.

In cases where the standard initialization files have already been loaded
into the saved core, and alternative ones should be used (or none at
all), SBCL allows customizing the initfile pathname computation.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2ASYSINIT-PATHNAME-FUNCTION-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*sysinit-pathname-function\*** *\#\<function sb-impl::sysinit-pathname>*

    Designator for a function of zero arguments called to obtain a
    pathname designator for the default sysinit file, or `nil`. If the
    function returns `nil`, no sysinit file is used unless one has been
    specified on the command-line.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2AUSERINIT-PATHNAME-FUNCTION-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*userinit-pathname-function\*** *\#\<function sb-impl::userinit-pathname>*

    Designator for a function of zero arguments called to obtain a
    pathname designator or a stream for the default userinit file, or `nil`.
    If the function returns `nil`, no userinit file is used unless one has
    been specified on the command-line.

To facilitate distribution of SBCL applications using external
resources, the filesystem location of the SBCL core file being used
is available from Lisp.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2ACORE-PATHNAME-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*core-pathname\*** *"\<site-specific>"*

    The absolute pathname of the running SBCL core.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40EXIT-ON-ERRORS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 3.2.4 Exit on Errors

SBCL can also be configured to exit if an unhandled error occurs,
which is mainly useful for acting as part of a shell pipeline; doing
so under most other circumstances would mean giving up large parts
of the flexibility and robustness of Common Lisp. See
[Debugger Entry][f102] and the command line option `--disable-debugger` in
[Runtime Options][3e4d].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40COMMAND-LINE-OPTIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 3.3 Command Line Options

Command line options can be considered an advanced topic; for ordinary
interactive use, no command line arguments should be necessary.

In order to understand the command line argument syntax for SBCL, it
is helpful to understand that the SBCL system is implemented as two
components, a low-level runtime environment written in C and a
higher-level system written in Common Lisp itself. Some command line
arguments are processed during the initialization of the low-level
runtime environment, some command line arguments are processed
during the initialization of the Common Lisp system, and any
remaining command line arguments are made available to user code via
[`sb-ext:*posix-argv*`][a5cc].

The full, unambiguous syntax for invoking SBCL at the command line
is:

    sbcl <runtime-option>* --end-runtime-options \
         <toplevel-option>* --end-toplevel-options \
         <user-option>*

For convenience, `--end-runtime-options` and
`--end-toplevel-options` can be omitted, which can be convenient
when you are running the program interactively, and you can see that
no ambiguities are possible with the option values you are using.
Omitting these elements is probably a bad idea for any batch file
where any of the options are under user control, since it makes it
impossible for SBCL to detect erroneous command line input, so that
erroneous command line arguments will be passed on to the user
program even if they was intended for the runtime system or the Lisp
system.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40RUNTIME-OPTIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 3.3.1 Runtime Options

- `--core <corefilename>`

    Run the specified Lisp core file instead of the default. Note
    that if the Lisp core file is a user-created core file, it may
    run a nonstandard toplevel which does not recognize the standard
    toplevel options.

- `--dynamic-space-size <megabytes>`

    Size of the dynamic space reserved on startup in megabytes.
    Default value is platform dependent.

- `--control-stack-size <megabytes>`

    Size of control stack reserved for each thread in megabytes.
    Default value is 2.

- `--tls-limit <positive integer>`

    Maximum number of thread-local symbols in threaded builds.
    Default value is 4096.

- `--noinform`

    Suppress the printing of any banner or other informational
    message at startup. This makes it easier to write Lisp programs
    which work cleanly in Unix pipelines. See also the `--noprint`
    and `--disable-debugger` options.

- `--disable-ldb`

    Disable the low-level debugger. Only effective if SBCL is
    compiled with `ldb`. disabling `ldb`

- `--lose-on-corruption`

    There are some dangerous low-level errors (for instance, control
    stack exhausted, memory fault) that (or whose handlers) can
    corrupt the image. By default, SBCL prints a warning, then tries
    to continue and handle the error in Lisp, but this will not
    always work, and SBCL may malfunction or even hang. With this
    option, upon encountering such an error, SBCL will exit instead
    of invoking `ldb` (if present and enabled enabling `ldb`).

- `--script <filename>`

    As a *runtime* option, this is equivalent to `--noinform`
    `--disable-ldb` `--lose-on-corruption`
    `--end-runtime-options` `--script` `<filename>`. See
    the description of `--script` as a *toplevel* option below.
    If there are no other command line arguments following
    `--script`, the filename argument can be omitted.

- `--merge-core-pages`

    When platform support is present, provide hints to the operating
    system that identical pages may be shared between processes
    until they are written to. This can be useful to reduce the
    memory usage on systems with multiple SBCL processes started
    from similar but differently-named core files, or from
    compressed cores. Without platform support, do nothing. By
    default only compressed cores trigger hinting.

- `--no-merge-core-pages`

    Ensures that no sharing hint is provided to the operating
    system.

- `--help`

    Print some basic information about SBCL, then exit.

- `--version`

    Print SBCL's version information, then exit.

In the future, runtime options may be added to control behaviour
such as lazy allocation of memory.

Runtime options, including any `--end-runtime-options` option, are
stripped out of the command line before the Lisp toplevel logic gets
a chance to see it.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40TOPLEVEL-OPTIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 3.3.2 Toplevel Options

The following options are processed and removed by the default
toplevel (see [`sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die`][9e55]).

- `--sysinit <filename>`

    Load `filename` instead of the default system initialization
    file (see [Initialization Files][1016]).

- `--no-sysinit`

    Don't load a system-wide initialization file. If this option is
    given, the `--sysinit` option is ignored.

- `--userinit <filename>`

    Load `filename` instead of the default user initialization file
    (see [Initialization Files][1016].)

- `--no-userinit`

    Don't load a user initialization file. If this option is given,
    the `--userinit` option is ignored.

- `--eval <command>`

    After executing any initialization file, but before starting the
    read-eval-print loop on standard input, read and evaluate
    `command`. More than one `--eval` option can be used, and all
    will be read and executed, in the order they appear on the
    command line.

- `--load <filename>`

    This is equivalent to `--eval '(load "<filename>")'`. The
    special syntax is intended to reduce quoting headaches when
    invoking SBCL from shell scripts.

- `--noprint`

    When ordinarily the toplevel "read-eval-print loop" would be
    executed, execute a "read-eval loop" instead, i.e. don't print
    a prompt and don't echo results. Combined with the `--noinform`
    runtime option, this makes it easier to write Lisp "scripts"
    which work cleanly in Unix pipelines.

- `--disable-debugger`

    By default when SBCL encounters an error, it enters the builtin
    debugger, allowing interactive diagnosis and possible
    intercession. This option disables the debugger, causing errors
    to print a backtrace and exit with status 1 instead. When given,
    this option takes effect before loading of initialization files
    or processing `--eval` and `--load` options. See
    [`sb-ext:disable-debugger`][356e] and [Debugger Entry][f102].

- `--script <filename>`

    Implies `--no-userinit` `--no-sysinit` `--disable-debugger`
    `--end-toplevel-options`.

    Causes the system to load the specified file instead of entering
    the read-eval-print-loop, and exit afterwards. If the file
    begins with a shebang line, it is ignored.

    If there are no other command line arguments following, the
    filename can be omitted: this causes the script to be loaded
    from standard input instead. Shebang lines in standard input
    script are currently *not* ignored.

    In either case, if there is an unhandled error (e.g. end of
    file, or a broken pipe) on either standard input, standard
    output, or standard error, the script silently exits with code
    0. This allows e.g. safely piping output from SBCL to `head -n1`
    or similar.

    Additionally, the option sets [`*compile-verbose*`][0961] and
    [`*load-verbose*`][93a7] to `nil` while loading the file to avoid
    potentially verbose diagnostic messages printed on the standard
    output.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40INITIALIZATION-FILES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 3.4 Initialization Files

SBCL processes initialization files with [`read`][fe58] and [`eval`][0d6e],
not [`load`][b5ec]; hence initialization files can be used to set startup
[`*package*`][5ed1] and [`*readtable*`][b79a], and for proclaiming a global optimization
policy.

- **System Initialization File:** Defaults to `$SBCL_HOME/sbclrc`,
  or if that doesn't exist to `/etc/sbclrc`. Can be overridden with
  the command line option `--sysinit` or `--no-sysinit` (see
  [Toplevel Options][6be4]).

    The system initialization file is intended for system
    administrators and software packagers to configure locations of
    installed third party modules, etc.

- **User Initialization File:** Defaults to `$HOME/.sbclrc`. Can be
  overridden with the command line option `--userinit` or
  `--no-userinit` (see [Toplevel Options][6be4]).

    The user initialization file is intended for personal
    customizations, such as loading certain modules at startup,
    defining convenience functions to use in the REPL,
    handling automatic recompilation of FASLs (see [FASL format][943e]),
    etc.

Neither initialization file is required.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40INITIALIZATION-AND-EXIT-HOOKS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 3.5 Initialization and Exit Hooks

SBCL provides hooks into the system initialization and exit.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2AINIT-HOOKS-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*init-hooks\*** *nil*

    A list of function designators which are called in an unspecified
    order when a saved core image starts up, after the system itself has
    been initialized, but before non-user threads such as the finalizer
    thread have been started.
    
    Unused by SBCL itself: reserved for user and applications.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2AEXIT-HOOKS-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*exit-hooks\*** *nil*

    A list of function designators which are called in an unspecified
    order when SBCL process exits.
    
    Unused by SBCL itself: reserved for user and applications.
    
    Using ([`sb-ext:exit`][7f27] `:abort` `t`), or calling `exit(3)` directly circumvents
    these hooks.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40COMPILER-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

## 4 Compiler

This chapter will discuss most compiler issues other than efficiency,
including compiler error messages, the SBCL compiler's unusual
approach to type safety in the presence of type declarations, the
effects of various compiler optimization policies, and the way that
inlining and open coding may cause optimized code to differ from a
naive translation. Efficiency issues are sufficiently varied and
separate that they have their own chapter, [Efficiency][29fd].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DIAGNOSTIC-MESSAGES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 4.1 Diagnostic Messages

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40CONTROLLING-VERBOSITY-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 4.1.1 Controlling Verbosity

The compiler can be quite verbose in its diagnostic reporting, rather
more then some users would prefer -- the amount of noise emitted can
be controlled, however.

To control emission of compiler diagnostics (of any severity other
than [`error`][669b]: [Diagnostic Severity][4dad]) use the [`sb-ext:muffle-conditions`][4697]
and [`sb-ext:unmuffle-conditions`][873a] declarations, specifying the type of
condition that is to be muffled (the muffling is done using an
associated [`muffle-warning`][6f51] restart).

Global control:

    ;;; Muffle compiler-notes globally
    (declaim (sb-ext:muffle-conditions sb-ext:compiler-note))

Local control:

    ;;; Muffle compiler-notes based on lexical scope
    (defun foo (x)
      (declare (optimize speed) (fixnum x)
               (sb-ext:muffle-conditions sb-ext:compiler-note))
      (values (* x 5) ; no compiler note from this
        (locally
          (declare (sb-ext:unmuffle-conditions sb-ext:compiler-note))
          ;; this one gives a compiler note
          (* x -5))))


<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AMUFFLE-CONDITIONS-20DECLARATION-29"></a>

- [declaration] **sb-ext:muffle-conditions**

    Syntax: `(sb-ext:muffle-conditions &rest types)`.
    
    Muffle the diagnostic messages that would be caused by compile-time
    signals of [`types`][7c9f].

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AUNMUFFLE-CONDITIONS-20DECLARATION-29"></a>

- [declaration] **sb-ext:unmuffle-conditions**

    Syntax: `(sb-ext:muffle-conditions &rest types)`.
    
    Cancel the effect of a previous [`sb-ext:muffle-conditions`][4697] declaration.

Various details of *how* the compiler messages are printed can be
controlled via the alist [`sb-ext:*compiler-print-variable-alist*`][a91a].

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2ACOMPILER-PRINT-VARIABLE-ALIST-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*compiler-print-variable-alist\*** *nil*

    An association list describing new bindings for special variables
    to be used by the compiler for error-reporting, etc.
    E.g. (([`*print-length*`][8f7a8] . 10) ([`*print-level*`][215b] . 6) ([`*print-pretty*`][782a] .
    `nil`)).
    
    The variables in the [`car`][d5a2] positions are bound to the values in the [`cdr`][e012]
    during the execution of some debug commands. When evaluating arbitrary
    expressions in the debugger, the normal values of the printer control
    variables are in effect.
    
    Initially empty, `*compiler-print-variable-alist*` is typically used
    to specify bindings for printer control variables.

For information about muffling warnings signaled outside of the
compiler, see [Customization Hooks for Users][b192].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DIAGNOSTIC-SEVERITY-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 4.1.2 Diagnostic Severity

There are four levels of compiler diagnostic severity:

- error

- warning

- style warning

- note

The first three levels correspond to condition classes which are
defined in the ANSI standard for Common Lisp and which have special
significance to the [`compile`][bc41] and [`compile-file`][0b69] functions. These levels
of compiler error severity occur when the compiler handles
conditions of these classes.

The fourth level of compiler error severity, *note*, corresponds to
the [`sb-ext:compiler-note`][0e19], and is used for problems which are too
mild for the standard condition classes, typically hints about how
efficiency might be improved. The [`sb-ext:code-deletion-note`][93bb], a
subtype of `sb-ext:compiler-note`, is signalled when the compiler
deletes user-supplied code after proving that the code in question
is unreachable.

Future work for SBCL includes expanding this hierarchy of types to
allow more fine-grained control over emission of diagnostic
messages.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ACOMPILER-NOTE-20CONDITION-29"></a>

- [condition] **sb-ext:compiler-note**

    Root of the hierarchy of conditions representing information discovered
    by the compiler that the user might wish to know, but which does not merit
    a [`style-warning`][2056] (or any more serious condition).

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ACODE-DELETION-NOTE-20CONDITION-29"></a>

- [condition] **sb-ext:code-deletion-note** *sb-int:simple-compiler-note*

    A condition type signalled when the compiler deletes code that the user
    has written, having proved that it is unreachable.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40UNDERSTANDING-COMPILER-DIAGNOSTICS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 4.1.3 Understanding Compiler Diagnostics

The messages emitted by the compiler contain a lot of detail in a
terse format, so they may be confusing at first. The messages will be
illustrated using this example program:

    (defmacro zoq (x)
      `(roq (ploq (+ ,x 3))))
    
    (defun foo (y)
      (declare (symbol y))
      (zoq y))

The main problem with this program is that it is trying to add `3`
to a symbol. Note also that the functions `roq` and `ploq` aren't
defined anywhere.

##### Parts of a Compiler Diagnostic

When processing this program, the compiler will produce this warning:

    ; file: /tmp/foo.lisp
    ; in: DEFUN FOO
    ;     (ZOQ Y)
    ; --> ROQ PLOQ
    ; ==>
    ;   (+ Y 3)
    ;
    ; caught WARNING:
    ;   Asserted type NUMBER conflicts with derived type (VALUES SYMBOL &OPTIONAL).

In this example we see each of the six possible parts of a compiler
diagnostic:

- `file: /tmp/foo.lisp` is the name of the file that the compiler
  read the relevant code from. The file name is displayed because it
  may not be immediately obvious when there is an error during
  compilation of a large system, especially when
  [`with-compilation-unit`][e7bf] is used to delay undefined warnings.

- `in: DEFUN FOO` is the definition top level form responsible for
  the diagnostic. It is obtained by taking the first two elements of
  the enclosing form whose first element is a symbol beginning with
  `def`. If there is no such enclosing `def` form, then the
  outermost form is used. If there are multiple `def` forms, then
  they are all printed from the outside in, separated by `=>`s. In
  this example, the problem was in the [`defun`][f472] for `foo`.

- `(zoq y)` is the *@ORIGINAL-SOURCE* form responsible for the
  diagnostic. Original source means that the form directly appeared
  in the original input to the compiler, i.e. in the lambda passed
  to [`compile`][bc41] or in the top level form read from the source file. In
  this example, the expansion of the `zoq` macro was responsible for
  the message.

- `--> roq ploq` This is the *@PROCESSING-PATH* that the compiler
  used to produce the code that caused the message to be emitted.
  The processing path is a representation of the evaluated forms
  enclosing the actual source that the compiler encountered when
  processing the original source. The path is the first element of
  each form, or the form itself if the form is not a list. These
  forms result from the expansion of macros or source-to-source
  transformation done by the compiler. In this example, the
  enclosing evaluated forms are the calls to `roq` and `ploq`. These
  calls resulted from the expansion of the `zoq` macro.

- `==> (+ y 3)` is the *actual source* responsible for the
  diagnostic. If the actual source appears in the explanation, then
  we print the next enclosing evaluated form, instead of printing
  the actual source twice. (This is the form that would otherwise
  have been the last form of the processing path.) In this example,
  the problem is with the evaluation of the reference to the
  variable `y`.

- `caught WARNING: Asserted type NUMBER conflicts with derived type
  (VALUES SYMBOL &OPTIONAL).` is the *explanation* of the problem.
  In this example, the problem is that, while the call to [`+`][0c83]
  requires that its arguments are all of type [`number`][4dee], the compiler
  has derived that Y will evaluate to a [`symbol`][e5af]. Note that
  `(values symbol &optional)` expresses that `y` evaluates to
  precisely one value.

Note that each part of the message is distinctively marked:

- `file:` and `in:` mark the file and definition, respectively.

- The original source is an indented form with no prefix.

- Each line of the processing path is prefixed with `-->`.

- The actual source form is indented like the original source, but
  is marked by a preceding `==>` line. (FIXME: no it isn't.)

- The explanation is prefixed with the diagnostic severity, which
  can be `caught ERROR:`, `caught WARNING:`, `caught
  STYLE-WARNING:`, or `note:`.

Each part of the message is more specific than the preceding one. If
consecutive messages are for nearby locations, then the front part
of the messages would be the same. In this case, the compiler omits
as much of the second message as in common with the first. For
example:

    ; file: /tmp/foo.lisp
    ; in: DEFUN FOO
    ;     (ZOQ Y)
    ; --> ROQ
    ; ==>
    ;   (PLOQ (+ Y 3))
    ;
    ; caught STYLE-WARNING:
    ;   undefined function: PLOQ
    
    ; ==>
    ;   (ROQ (PLOQ (+ Y 3)))
    ;
    ; caught STYLE-WARNING:
    ;   undefined function: ROQ

In this example, the file, definition and original source are
identical for the two messages, so the compiler omits them in the
second message. If consecutive messages are entirely identical, then
the compiler prints only the first message, followed by: `[Last
message occurs <repeats> times]` where `<repeats>` is the number of
times the message was given.

If the source was not from a file, then no file line is printed. If
the actual source is the same as the original source, then the
processing path and actual source will be omitted. If no forms
intervene between the original source and the actual source, then
the processing path will also be omitted.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40ORIGINAL-AND-ACTUAL-SOURCE-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

##### Original and Actual Source

The *original source* displayed will almost always be a list. If
the actual source for an message is a symbol, the original source will
be the immediately enclosing evaluated list form. So even if the
offending symbol does appear in the original source, the compiler will
print the enclosing list and then print the symbol as the actual
source (as though the symbol were introduced by a macro.)

When the *actual source* is displayed (and is not a symbol), it will
always be code that resulted from the expansion of a macro or a
source-to-source compiler optimization. This is code that did not
appear in the original source program; it was introduced by the
compiler.

Keep in mind that when the compiler displays a source form in an
diagnostic message, it always displays the most specific (innermost)
responsible form. For example, compiling this function

    (defun bar (x)
      (let (a)
        (declare (fixnum a))
        (setq a (foo x))
        a))

gives this error message

    ; file: /tmp/foo.lisp
    ; in: DEFUN BAR
    ;     (LET (A)
    ;     (DECLARE (FIXNUM A))
    ;     (SETQ A (FOO X))
    ;     A)
    ;
    ; caught WARNING:
    ;   Asserted type FIXNUM conflicts with derived type (VALUES NULL &OPTIONAL).

This message is not saying that there is a problem somewhere in this
[`let`][4853] -- it is saying that there is a problem with the `let` itself. In
this example, the problem is that `a`'s `nil` initial value is not a
[`fixnum`][3cde].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40PROCESSING-PATHS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

##### Processing Paths

The processing path is mainly useful for debugging macros, so if you
don't write macros, you can probably ignore it. Consider this example:

    (defun foo (n)
      (dotimes (i n *undefined*)))

Compiling results in this error message:

    ; in: DEFUN FOO
    ;     (DOTIMES (I N *UNDEFINED*))
    ; --> DO BLOCK LET TAGBODY RETURN-FROM
    ; ==>
    ;   (PROGN *UNDEFINED*)
    ;
    ; caught WARNING:
    ;   undefined variable: *UNDEFINED*

Note that [`do`][5d2b] appears in the processing path. This is because
[`dotimes`][aa56] expands into:

    (do ((i 0 (1+ i)) (#:g1 n))
        ((>= i #:g1) *undefined*)
      (declare (type unsigned-byte i)))

The rest of the processing path results from the macroexpansion of
`do`: 

    (block nil
      (let ((i 0) (#:g1 n))
        (declare (type unsigned-byte i))
        (tagbody (go #:g3)
          #:g2    (psetq i (1+ i))
          #:g3    (unless (>= i #:g1) (go #:g2))
          (return-from nil (progn *undefined*)))))

In this example, the compiler descended into the [`block`][d2d8], [`let`][4853], [`tagbody`][7fae]
and [`return-from`][3eef] to reach the [`progn`][0cc3] printed as the actual source.
This is a place where the "actual source appears in explanation"
rule was applied. The innermost actual source form was the symbol
*undefined* itself, but that also appeared in the explanation, so
the compiler backed out one level.

### 4.2 Handling of Types

One of the most important features of the SBCL compiler (similar to
the original CMUCL compiler, also known as *Python*) is its fairly
sophisticated understanding of the Common Lisp type system and its
conservative approach to the implementation of type declarations.

These two features reward the use of type declarations throughout
development, even when high performance is not a concern. Also, as
discussed in the chapter on performance (see [Efficiency][29fd]), the use
of appropriate type declarations can be very important for
performance as well.

The SBCL compiler also has a greater knowledge of the Common Lisp
type system than other compilers. Support is incomplete only for
types involving the [`satisfies`][2b8b] type specifier.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DECLARATIONS-AS-ASSERTIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 4.2.1 Declarations as Assertions

The SBCL compiler treats type declarations differently from most other
Lisp compilers. Under default compilation policy the compiler doesn't
blindly believe type declarations, but considers them assertions about
the program that should be checked: all type declarations that have
not been proven to always hold are asserted at runtime.

*Remaining bugs in the compiler's handling of types unfortunately
provide some exceptions to this rule, see
[Implementation Limitations][5ebc].*

CLOS slot types form a notable exception. Types declared using the
`:type` slot option in [`defclass`][ead6] are asserted if and only if the class
was defined in *safe code*  and the slot access location is
in *safe code* as well. This laxness does not pose any internal
consistency issues, as the CLOS slot types are not available for the
type inferencer, nor do CLOS slot types provide any efficiency
benefits.

There are three type checking policies available in SBCL, selectable
via [`optimize`][4d51] declarations.

- **Full Type Checks**

    All declarations are considered assertions to be checked at
    runtime, and all type checks are precise. The default
    compilation policy provides full type checks.

    Used when `(or (>= safety 2) (>= safety speed 1))`.

- **Weak Type Checks**

    Declared types may be simplified into faster to check
    supertypes: for example, `(or (integer -17 -7) (integer 7 17))`
    is simplified into `(integer -17 17)`.

    > **Warning**: It is relatively easy to corrupt the heap when
    > weak type checks are used if the program contains type-errors.

    Used when `(and (< safety 2) (< safety speed))`.

- **No Type Checks**

    All declarations are believed without assertions. Also disables
    argument count and array bounds checking.

    > **Warning**: Any type errors in code where type checks are not
    > performed are liable to corrupt the heap.

    Used when `(= safety 0)`.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40PRECISE-TYPE-CHECKING-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 4.2.2 Precise Type Checking

Precise checking means that the check is done as though [`typep`][0895]
had been called with the exact type specifier that appeared in the
declaration.

If a variable is declared to be `(integer 3 17)`, then its value
must always be an integer between `3` and `17`. If multiple type
declarations apply to a single variable, then all the declarations
must be correct; it is as though all the types were intersected
producing a single [`and`][dd55] type specifier.

To gain maximum benefit from the compiler's type checking, you
should always declare the types of function arguments and structure
slots as precisely as possible. This often involves the use of [`or`][8808],
[`member`][0376], and other list-style type specifiers.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40GETTING-EXISTING-PROGRAMS-TO-RUN-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 4.2.3 Getting Existing Programs to Run

Since SBCL's compiler does much more comprehensive type checking than
most Lisp compilers, SBCL may detect type errors in programs that have
been debugged using other compilers. These errors are mostly incorrect
declarations, although compile-time type errors can find actual bugs
if parts of the program have never been tested.

Some incorrect declarations can only be detected by run-time type
checking. It is very important to initially compile a program with
full type checks (high safety optimization) and then test this safe
version. After the checking version has been tested, then you can
consider weakening or eliminating type checks. *This applies even to
previously debugged programs* because the SBCL compiler does much
more type inference than other Common Lisp compilers, so an
incorrect declaration can do more damage.

The most common problem is with variables whose constant initial
value doesn't match the type declaration. Incorrect constant initial
values will always be flagged by a compile-time type error, and they
are simple to fix once located. Consider this code fragment:

    (prog (foo)
      (declare (fixnum foo))
      (setq foo ...)
      ...)

Here `foo` is given an initial value of `nil` but is declared to be a
[`fixnum`][3cde]. Even if it is never read, the initial value of a variable
must match the declared type. There are two ways to fix this
problem. Change the declaration

    (prog (foo)
      (declare (type (or fixnum null) foo))
      (setq foo ...)
      ...)

or change the initial value

    (prog ((foo 0))
      (declare (fixnum foo))
      (setq foo ...)
      ...)

It is generally preferable to change to a legal initial value rather
than to weaken the declaration, but sometimes it is simpler to
weaken the declaration than to try to make an initial value of the
appropriate type.

Another declaration problem occasionally encountered is incorrect
declarations on [`defmacro`][14cb] arguments. This can happen when a function
is converted into a macro. Consider this macro:

    (defmacro my-1+ (x)
      (declare (fixnum x))
      `(the fixnum (1+ ,x)))

Although legal and well-defined Common Lisp code, this meaning of
this definition is almost certainly not what the writer intended.
For example, this call is illegal:

    (my-1+ (+ 4 5))

This call is illegal because the argument to the macro is `(+ 4 5)`,
which is a [`list`][9271], not a `fixnum`. Because of macro semantics, it is
hardly ever useful to declare the types of macro arguments. If you
really want to assert something about the type of the result of
evaluating a macro argument, then put a [`the`][311a] in the expansion:

    (defmacro my-1+ (x)
      `(the fixnum (1+ (the fixnum ,x))))

In this case, it would be stylistically preferable to change this
macro back to a function and declare it inline.

Some more subtle problems are caused by incorrect declarations that
can't be detected at compile time. Consider this code:

    (do ((pos 0 (position #a string :start (1+ pos))))
      ((null pos))
      (declare (fixnum pos))
      ...)

Although `pos` is almost always a [`fixnum`][3cde], it is `nil` at the end of
the loop. If this example is compiled with full type checks (the
default), then running it will signal a type error at the end of the
loop. If compiled without type checks, the program will go into an
infinite loop (or perhaps [`position`][04ab] will complain because `(1+ nil)`
isn't a sensible start.) Why? Because if you compile without type
checks, the compiler just quietly believes the type declaration.
Since the compiler believes that `pos` is always a `fixnum`, it
believes that `pos` is never `nil`, so `(null pos)` is never true, and
the loop exit test is optimized away. Such errors are sometimes
flagged by unreachable code notes, but it is still important to
initially compile and test any system with full type checks, even if
the system works fine when compiled using other compilers.

In this case, the fix is to weaken the type declaration to `(or
fixnum null)`. (Actually, this declaration is unnecessary in SBCL,
since it already knows that `position` returns a non-negative `fixnum`
or `nil`.)

Note that there is usually little performance penalty for weakening
a declaration in this way. Any numeric operations in the body can
still assume that the variable is a `fixnum`, since `nil` is not a legal
numeric argument. Another possible fix would be to say:

    (do ((pos 0 (position #a string :start (1+ pos))))
        ((null pos))
      (let ((pos pos))
        (declare (fixnum pos))
        ...))

This would be preferable in some circumstances, since it would allow
a non-standard representation to be used for the local `pos`
variable in the loop body.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40IMPLEMENTATION-LIMITATIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 4.2.4 Implementation Limitations

If an [`ftype`][05c1] is placed after the function definition the function won't
perform any type checks, and the calls to the function will blindly
trust the declared types.
([`optimize`][4d51] ([`debug`][5df9] 3)) will not trust any `ftype` declarations.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40COMPILER-POLICY-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 4.3 Compiler Policy

Compiler policy is controlled by the [`optimize`][4d51] declaration,
supporting all ANSI optimization qualities ([`debug`][5df9], safety, space,
and speed). (A deprecated extension `sb-ext:inhibit-warnings` is still
supported but liable to go away at any time.)

For effects of various optimization qualities on type-safety and
debuggability see [Declarations as Assertions][5848] and
[Debugger Policy Control][faf1].

Ordinarily, when the speed quality is high, the compiler emits notes
to notify the programmer about its inability to apply various
optimizations. For selective muffling of these notes, see
[Controlling Verbosity][9578].

The value of space mostly influences the compiler's decision whether
to inline operations, which tend to increase the size of programs.
Use the value `0` with caution, since it can cause the compiler to
inline operations so indiscriminately that the net effect is to slow
the program by causing cache misses or even swapping.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ADESCRIBE-COMPILER-POLICY-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:describe-compiler-policy** *&optional spec*

    Print all global optimization settings, augmented by `spec`.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ARESTRICT-COMPILER-POLICY-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:restrict-compiler-policy** *&optional quality (min 0) (max 3)*

    Assign a minimum value to an optimization quality. `quality` is the name of
    the optimization quality to restrict, `min` (defaulting to zero) is the
    minimum allowed value, and `max` (defaults to 3) is the maximum.
    
    Returns the alist describing the current policy restrictions.
    
    If `quality` is `nil` or not given, nothing is done.
    
    Otherwise, if `min` is zero or `max` is 3 or neither are given, any
    existing restrictions of `quality` are removed.
    
    See also `:policy` option in [`with-compilation-unit`][e7bf].

<a id="x-28WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **with-compilation-unit** *options &body body*

    Affects compilations that take place within its dynamic extent. It is
    intended to be eg. wrapped around the compilation of all files in the same system.
    
    Following options are defined:
    
    - `:override` `<boolean-form>`
    
        One of the effects of this form is to delay undefined warnings
        until the end of the form, instead of giving them at the end of
        each compilation. If `override` is `nil` (the default), then the
        outermost `with-compilation-unit` form grabs the undefined warnings.
        Specifying `:override` true causes that form to grab any enclosed
        warnings, even if it is enclosed by another `with-compilation-unit`.
    
    - `:policy` `<optimize-declaration-form>`
    
        Provides dynamic scoping for global compiler optimization
        qualities and restrictions, limiting effects of subsequent
        [`optimize`][4d51] proclamations and calls to
        [`sb-ext:restrict-compiler-policy`][72f1] to the dynamic scope of `body`.
    
        If `:override` is false, the specified `:policy` is merged with
        current global policy. If `:override` is true, current global
        policy, including any restrictions, is discarded in favor of the
        specified
        `:policy`.
    
        Supplying `:policy` `nil` is equivalent to the option not being
        supplied at all, i.e. dynamic scoping of policy does not take
        place.
    
        This option is an SBCL-specific experimental extension: Interface
        subject to change.
    
    - `:source-namestring` `<namestring-form>`
    
        Attaches the value returned by the `<namestring-form>` to the
        internal debug-source information as the namestring of the source
        file. Normally the namestring of the input-file for [`compile-file`][0b69]
        is used: this option can be used to provide source-file
        information for functions compiled using [`compile`][bc41], or to override
        the input-file of `compile-file`.
    
        If both an outer and an inner `with-compilation-unit` provide a
        `:source-namestring`, the inner one takes precedence. Unaffected by
        `:override`.
    
        This is an SBCL-specific extension.
    
    - `:source-plist` `<plist-form>`
    
        Attaches the value returned by the `<plist-form>` to internal
        debug-source information of functions compiled in within the
        dynamic extent of `body`.
    
        Primarily for use by development environments, in order to eg.
        associate function definitions with editor-buffers. Can be
        accessed using [`sb-introspect:definition-source-plist`][84b1].
    
        If an outer `with-compilation-unit` form also provide a
        `source-plist`, it is appended to the end of the provided
        `source-plist`. Unaffected by `:override`.
    
        This is an SBCL-specific extension.
    
    Examples:
    
    ```
    ;; Prevent proclamations from the file leaking, and restrict
    ;; SAFETY to 3 -- otherwise uses the current global policy.
    (with-compilation-unit (:policy '(optimize))
      (restrict-compiler-policy 'safety 3)
      (load "foo.lisp"))
    ```
    
    ```
    ;; Using default policy instead of the current global one,
    ;; except for DEBUG 3.
    (with-compilation-unit (:policy '(optimize debug)
                            :override t)
      (load "foo.lisp"))
    ```
    
    ```
    ;; Same as if :POLICY had not been specified at all: SAFETY 3
    ;; proclamation leaks out from WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT.
    (with-compilation-unit (:policy nil)
      (declaim (optimize safety))
      (load "foo.lisp"))
    ```

### 4.4 Compiler Errors

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40TYPE-ERRORS-AT-COMPILE-TIME-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 4.4.1 Type Errors at Compile Time

If the compiler can prove at compile time that some portion of the
program cannot be executed without a type error, then it will give a
warning at compile time.

It is possible that the offending code would never actually be
executed at run-time due to some higher level consistency constraint
unknown to the compiler, so a type warning doesn't always indicate an
incorrect program.

For example, consider this code fragment:

    (defun raz (foo)
      (let ((x (case foo
                  (:this 13)
                  (:that 9)
                  (:the-other 42))))
        (declare (fixnum x))
        (foo x)))

Compilation produces this warning:

    ; in: DEFUN RAZ
    ;     (CASE FOO (:THIS 13) (:THAT 9) (:THE-OTHER 42))
    ; --> LET COND IF COND IF COND IF
    ; ==>
    ;   (COND)
    ;
    ; caught WARNING:
    ;   This is not a FIXNUM:
    ;   NIL

In this case, the warning means that if `foo` isn't any of `:this`,
`:that` or `:the-other`, then `x` will be initialized to `nil`, which
the [`fixnum`][3cde] declaration makes illegal. The warning will go away if
[`ecase`][c036] is used instead of [`case`][b23d], or if `:the-other` is changed to `t`.

This sort of spurious type warning happens moderately often in the
expansion of complex macros and in inline functions. In such cases,
there may be dead code that is impossible to correctly execute. The
compiler can't always prove this code is dead (could never be
executed), so it compiles the erroneous code (which will always signal
an error if it is executed) and gives a warning.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40ERRORS-DURING-MACROEXPANSION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 4.4.2 Errors During Macroexpansion

The compiler handles errors that happen during macroexpansion, turning
them into compiler errors. If you want to debug the error (to debug
a macro), you can set [`*break-on-signals*`][ee75] to [`error`][669b]. For example, this
definition:

    (defun foo (e l)
      (do ((current l (cdr current))
           ((atom current) nil))
          (when (eq (car current) e) (return current))))

gives this error:

    ; in: DEFUN FOO

#### 4.4.3 Read Errors

SBCL's compiler does not attempt to recover from read errors when
reading a source file, but instead just reports the offending
character position and gives up on the entire source file.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40OPEN-CODING-AND-INLINE-EXPANSION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 4.5 Open Coding and Inline Expansion

Since Common Lisp forbids the redefinition of standard functions, the
compiler can have special knowledge of these standard functions
embedded in it. This special knowledge is used in various ways (open
coding, inline expansion, source transformation), but the implications
to the user are basically the same:

- Attempts to redefine standard functions may be frustrated, since
  the function may never be called. Although it is technically
  illegal to redefine standard functions, users sometimes want to
  implicitly redefine these functions when they are debugging using
  the [`trace`][548d] macro. Special-casing of standard functions can be
  inhibited using the [`notinline`][9514] declaration, but even then some
  phases of analysis such as type inferencing are applied by the
  compiler.

- The compiler can have multiple alternate implementations of
  standard functions that implement different trade-offs of speed,
  space and safety. This selection is based on the [Compiler Policy][2474].

When a function call is *open coded*, inline code whose effect is
equivalent to the function call is substituted for that function
call. When a function call is *closed coded*, it is usually left as
is, although it might be turned into a call to a different function
with different arguments. As an example, if [`nthcdr`][e113] were to be open
coded, then

    (nthcdr 4 foobar)

might turn into

    (cdr (cdr (cdr (cdr foobar))))

or even

    (do ((i 0 (1+ i))
      (list foobar (cdr foobar)))
      ((= i 4) list))

If [`nth`][1aa3] is closed coded, then

    (nth x l)

might stay the same, or turn into something like

    (car (nthcdr x l))

In general, open coding sacrifices space for speed, but some functions
(such as [`car`][d5a2]) are so simple that they are always open-coded. Even
when not open-coded, a call to a standard function may be
transformed into a different function call (as in the last example)
or compiled as *static call*. Static function call uses a more
efficient calling convention that forbids redefinition.

### 4.6 Interpreter

By default SBCL implements [`eval`][0d6e] by calling the native code
compiler.

SBCL also includes an interpreter for use in special cases where
using the compiler is undesirable, for example due to compilation
overhead. Unlike in some other Lisp implementations, in SBCL
interpreted code is not safer or more debuggable than compiled code.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2AEVALUATOR-MODE-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*evaluator-mode\*** *:compile*

    Toggle between different evaluator implementations. If set to `:compile`,
    an implementation of [`eval`][0d6e] that calls the compiler will be used. If set
    to `:interpret`, an interpreter will be used.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40ADVANCED-COMPILER-USE-AND-EFFICIENCY-HINTS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 4.7 Advanced Compiler Use and Efficiency Hints

For more advanced usages of the compiler, please see the chapter of the
same name in the CMUCL manual. Many aspects of the compiler have stayed
exactly the same, and there is a much more detailed explanation of the
compiler's behavior and how to maximally optimize code in their
manual. In particular, while SBCL no longer supports byte-code
compilation, it does support CMUCL's block compilation facility allowing
whole program optimization and increased use of the local call
convention.

Unlike CMUCL, SBCL is able to open-code forward-referenced type
tests while block compiling. This helps for mutually referential
[`defstruct`][eac1]s in particular.

## 5 Debugger

This chapter documents the debugging facilities of SBCL, including
the debugger, single-stepper and [`trace`][548d], and the effect of `(optimize
debug)` declarations.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DEBUGGER-ENTRY-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 5.1 Debugger Entry

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DEBUGGER-BANNER-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 5.1.1 Debugger Banner

When you enter the debugger, it looks something like this:

    debugger invoked on a TYPE-ERROR in thread 11184:
      The value 3 is not of type LIST.
    
    You can type HELP for debugger help, or (SB-EXT:QUIT) to exit from SBCL.
    
    restarts (invokable by number or by possibly-abbreviated name):
      0: [ABORT   ] Reduce debugger level (leaving debugger, returning to toplevel).
      1: [TOPLEVEL] Restart at toplevel READ/EVAL/PRINT loop.
    (CAR 1 3)
    0]

The first group of lines describe what the error was that put us in
the debugger. In this case [`car`][d5a2] was called on `3`, causing a
[`type-error`][abfd].

This is followed by the "beginner help line", which appears only
if `sb-debug:*debug-beginner-help-p*` is true (default).

Next comes a listing of the active restart names, along with their
descriptions -- the ways we can restart execution after this error.
In this case, both options return to top-level. Restarts can be
selected by entering the corresponding number or name.

The current frame appears right underneath the restarts, immediately
followed by the debugger prompt.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DEBUGGER-INVOCATION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 5.1.2 Debugger Invocation

The debugger is invoked when:

- [`error`][669b] is called, and the condition it signals is not handled.

- [`break`][7598] is called, or [`signal`][8f49] is called with a condition that matches
  the current [`*break-on-signals*`][ee75].

- The debugger is explicitly entered with the [`invoke-debugger`][de5c]
  function.

When the debugger is invoked by a condition, ANSI mandates that the
value of [`*debugger-hook*`][1cdc], if any, be called with two arguments: the
condition that caused the debugger to be invoked and the previous
value of `*debugger-hook*`. When this happens, `*debugger-hook*` is
bound to `nil` to prevent recursive errors. However, ANSI also
mandates that `*debugger-hook*` not be invoked when the debugger is to
be entered by the [`break`][7598] function. For users who wish to provide an
alternate debugger interface (and thus catch `break` entries into the
debugger), SBCL provides [`sb-ext:*invoke-debugger-hook*`][4d8c], which is
invoked during any entry into the debugger.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2AINVOKE-DEBUGGER-HOOK-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*invoke-debugger-hook\*** *nil*

    This is either `nil` or a designator for a function of two arguments,
    to be run when the debugger is about to be entered. The function is
    run with `*invoke-debugger-hook*` bound to `nil` to minimize
    recursive errors, and receives as arguments the condition that
    triggered debugger entry and the previous value of
    `*invoke-debugger-hook*`.
    
    This mechanism is an SBCL extension similar to the standard [`*debugger-hook*`][1cdc].
    In contrast to `*debugger-hook*`, it is observed by [`invoke-debugger`][de5c] even when
    called by [`break`][7598].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DEBUGGER-COMMAND-LOOP-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 5.2 Debugger Command Loop

The debugger is an interactive read-eval-print loop much like the
normal top level, but some symbols are interpreted as debugger
commands instead of being evaluated. A debugger command starts with
the symbol name of the command, possibly followed by some arguments
on the same line. Some commands prompt for additional input.
Debugger commands can be abbreviated by any unambiguous prefix:
`help` can be typed as `h`, `he`, etc.

The package is not significant in debugger commands; any symbol with
the name of a debugger command will work. If you want to show the
value of a variable that happens also to be the name of a debugger
command you can wrap the variable in a [`progn`][0cc3] to hide it from
the command loop.

The debugger prompt is `<frame>]`, where `<frame>` is the number of
the current frame. Frames are numbered starting from zero at the
top (most recent call), increasing down to the bottom. The current
frame is the frame that commands refer to.

It is possible to override the normal printing behaviour in the
debugger by using the [`sb-ext:*debug-print-variable-alist*`][21be].

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2ADEBUG-PRINT-VARIABLE-ALIST-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*debug-print-variable-alist\*** *nil*

    an association list describing new bindings for special variables
    to be used within the debugger. Eg.
    
    (([`*print-length*`][8f7a8] . 10) ([`*print-level*`][215b] . 6) ([`*print-pretty*`][782a] . `nil`))
    
    The variables in the [`car`][d5a2] positions are bound to the values in the [`cdr`][e012]
    during the execution of some debug commands. When evaluating arbitrary
    expressions in the debugger, the normal values of the printer control
    variables are in effect.
    
    Initially empty, `*debug-print-variable-alist*` is typically used to
    provide bindings for printer control variables.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40STACK-FRAMES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 5.3 Stack Frames

A *stack frame* is the run-time representation of a call to a
function; the frame stores the state that a function needs to
remember what it is doing. Frames have:

- *Variables* (see [Variable Access][78b8]), which are the values being
  operated on.

- *Arguments* to the call (which are really just particularly
  interesting variables).

- A current source location ([Source Location Printing][c9e6]), which is
  the place in the program where the function was running when it
  stopped to call another function, or because of an interrupt or
  error.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40STACK-MOTION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 5.3.1 Stack Motion

These commands move to a new stack frame and print the name of the
function and the values of its arguments in the style of a Lisp
function call:

- `up`: Move up to the next higher frame. More recent function calls
   are considered to be higher on the stack.

- `down`: Move down to the next lower frame.

- `top`: Move to the highest frame, that is, the frame where the
  debugger was entered.

- `bottom`: Move to the lowest frame.

- `frame [<n>]`: Move to the frame with the specified number.
  Prompts for the number if not supplied. The frame with number 0 is
  the frame where the debugger was entered.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40HOW-ARGUMENTS-ARE-PRINTED-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 5.3.2 How Arguments are Printed

A frame is printed to look like a function call, but with the actual
argument values in the argument positions.  So the frame for this call
in the source:

    (myfun (+ 3 4) 'a)

would look like this:

    (MYFUN 7 A)

All keyword and optional arguments are displayed with their actual
values; if the corresponding argument was not supplied, the value will
be the default.  So this call:

    (subseq "foo" 1)

would look like this:

    (SUBSEQ "foo" 1 3)

And this call:

    (string-upcase "test case")

would look like this:

    (STRING-UPCASE "test case" :START 0 :END NIL)

The arguments to a function call are displayed by accessing the
argument variables. Although those variables are initialized to the
actual argument values, they can be set inside the function; in this
case the new value will be displayed.

[`&rest`][4336] arguments are handled somewhat differently. The value of the
rest argument variable is displayed as the spread-out arguments to
the call, so:

    (format t "~A is a ~A." "This" 'test)

would look like this:

    (FORMAT T "~A is a ~A." "This" 'TEST)

Rest arguments cause an exception to the normal display of keyword
arguments in functions that have both [`&rest`][4336] and [`&key`][4336] arguments. In
this case, the keyword argument variables are not displayed at all;
the rest arg is displayed instead. So for these functions, only the
keywords actually supplied will be shown, and the values displayed
will be the argument values, not values of the
(possibly modified) variables.

If the variable for an argument is never referenced by the function,
it will be deleted. The variable value is then unavailable, so the
debugger prints `#<unused-arg>` instead of the value. Similarly, if
for any of a number of reasons the value of the variable is
unavailable or not known to be available ([Variable Access][78b8]), then
`#<unavailable-arg>` will be printed instead of the argument value.

Note that inline expansion and open-coding affect what frames are
present in the debugger, see [Debugger Policy Control][faf1].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40FUNCTION-NAMES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 5.3.3 Function Names

If a function is defined by [`defun`][f472] it will appear in backtrace
by that name. Functions defined by [`labels`][c2ef] and [`flet`][091c] will appear as
`(flet <name>)` and `(labels <name>)` respectively. Anonymous
lambdas will appear as `(lambda <lambda-list>)`.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40ENTRY-POINT-DETAILS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

##### Entry Point Details

Sometimes the compiler introduces new functions that are used to
implement a user function, but are not directly specified in the
source. This is mostly done for argument type and count checking.

With recursive or block compiled functions, an additional `external`
frame may appear before the frame representing the first call to the
recursive function or entry to the compiled block. This is a
consequence of the way the compiler works: there is nothing odd with
your program. You may also see `cleanup` frames during the execution
of [`unwind-protect`][c93f] cleanup code, and `optional` for variable argument
entry points.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DEBUG-TAIL-RECURSION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 5.3.4 Debug Tail Recursion

The compiler is *properly tail recursive*. If a function call is
in a tail recursive position, the stack frame will be deallocated
*at the time of the call*, rather than after the call returns.
Consider this backtrace:

    (BAR ...)
    (FOO ...)

Because of tail recursion, it is not necessarily the case that `foo`
directly called `bar`. It may be that `foo` called some other
function `foo2`, which then called `bar` tail-recursively, as in
this example:

    (defun foo ()
      ...
      (foo2 ...)
      ...)
    
    (defun foo2 (...)
      ...
      (bar ...))
    
    (defun bar (...)
      ...)

Usually the elimination of tail-recursive frames makes debugging
more pleasant, since these frames are mostly uninformative. If there
is any doubt about how one function called another, it can usually
be eliminated by finding the source location in the calling frame.
See [Source Location Printing][c9e6].

The elimination of tail-recursive frames can be prevented by
disabling tail-recursion optimization, which happens when the [`debug`][5df9]
optimization quality is greater than 2. See
[Debugger Policy Control][faf1].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40UNKNOWN-LOCATIONS-AND-INTERRUPTS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 5.3.5 Unknown Locations and Interrupts

The debugger operates using special debugging information attached to
the compiled code. This debug information tells the debugger what it
needs to know about the locations in the code where the debugger can
be invoked. If the debugger somehow encounters a location not
described in the debug information, then it is said to be *unknown*.
If the code location for a frame is unknown, then some variables may
be inaccessible, and the source location cannot be precisely
displayed.

There are three reasons why a code location could be unknown:

- There is inadequate debug information due to the value of the
  [`debug`][5df9] optimization quality. See [Debugger Policy Control][faf1].

- The debugger was entered because of an interrupt such as `C-c`.

- A hardware error  such as a bus error occurred in
  code that was compiled unsafely due to the value of the [`safety`][f384]
  optimization quality.


In the last two cases, the values of argument variables are
accessible, but may be incorrect. For more details on when variable
values are accessible, see [Variable Value Availability][1298].

It is possible for an interrupt to happen when a function call or
return is in progress. The debugger may then flame out with some
obscure error or insist that the bottom of the stack has been
reached, when the real problem is that the current stack frame can't
be located. If this happens, return from the interrupt and try
again.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40VARIABLE-ACCESS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 5.4 Variable Access

There are two ways to access the current frame's local variables in
the debugger: `list-locals` and [`sb-debug:var`][a625].

The debugger doesn't really understand lexical scoping; it has just
one namespace for all the variables in the current stack frame. If a
symbol is the name of multiple variables in the same function, then
the reference appears ambiguous, even though lexical scoping
specifies which value is visible at any given source location. If
the scopes of the two variables are not nested, then the debugger
can resolve the ambiguity by observing that only one variable is
accessible.

When there are ambiguous variables, the evaluator assigns each one a
small integer identifier. The [`sb-debug:var`][a625] function uses this
identifier to distinguish between ambiguous variables. The
`list-locals` command prints the identifier. In the following
example, there are two variables named `x`. The first one has
identifier 0 (which is not printed), the second one has identifier
1.

    X  =  1
    X#1  =  2

- `list-locals [<prefix>]`: This command prints the name and value
  of all variables in the current frame whose name has the specified
  `<prefix>`, which may be a string or a symbol. If no `<prefix>` is
  given, then all available variables are printed. If a variable has
  a potentially ambiguous name, then the name is printed with a
  `#<identifier>` suffix, where `<identifier>` is the small integer
  used to make the name unique.


<a id="x-28SB-DEBUG-3AVAR-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-debug:var** *name &optional (id 0)*

    Return a variable's value if possible. `name` is a simple-string or symbol.
    If it is a simple-string, it is an initial substring of the
    variable's name. If name is a symbol, it has the same name and
    package as the variable whose value this function returns. If the
    symbol is uninterned, then the variable has the same name as the
    symbol, but it has no package.
    
    If name is the initial substring of variables with different names,
    then this returns no values after displaying the ambiguous names.
    If name determines multiple variables with the same name, then you
    must use the optional `id` argument to specify which one you want. If
    you left `id` unspecified, then this returns no values after
    displaying the distinguishing id values.
    
    The result of this function is limited to the availability of
    variable information. This is [`setf`][a138]able.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40VARIABLE-VALUE-AVAILABILITY-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 5.4.1 Variable Value Availability

The value of a variable may be unavailable to the debugger in portions
of the program where Lisp says that the variable is defined. If a
variable value is not available, the debugger will not let you read
or write that variable. With one exception, the debugger will never
display an incorrect value for a variable. Rather than displaying
incorrect values, the debugger tells you the value is unavailable.

The one exception is this: if you interrupt (e.g. with `C-c`) or if
there is an unexpected hardware error such as a bus error (which
should only happen in unsafe code), then the values displayed for
arguments to the interrupted frame might be incorrect. This
exception applies only to the interrupted frame: any frame farther
down the stack will be fine.

> *Note*: Since the location of an interrupt or hardware error will
> always be an unknown location, non-argument variable values will
> never be available in the interrupted frame. See
> [Unknown Locations and Interrupts][2496].)

The value of a variable may be unavailable for these reasons:

- The value of the debug optimization quality may have omitted
  debug information needed to determine whether the variable is
  available. Unless a variable is an argument, its value will only
  be available when [`debug`][5df9] is at least 2.

- The compiler did lifetime analysis and determined that the value
  was no longer needed, even though its scope had not been exited.
  Lifetime analysis is inhibited when the `debug` optimization
  quality is 3.

- The variable's name is an uninterned symbol (gensym). To save
  space, the compiler only dumps debug information about uninterned
  variables when the `debug` optimization quality is 3.

- The frame's location is unknown (see
  [Unknown Locations and Interrupts][2496]) because the debugger was
  entered due to an interrupt or unexpected hardware error. Under
  these conditions the values of arguments will be available, but
  might be incorrect. This is the exception mentioned above.

- The variable (or the code referencing it) was optimized out of
  existence. Variables with no reads are always optimized away. The
  degree to which the compiler deletes variables will depend on the
  value of the [`compilation-speed`][705f] optimization quality, but most
  source-level optimizations are done under all compilation
  policies.

- The variable is never set and its definition looks like

        (LET ((var1 var2))
           ...)

    In this case, `var1` is substituted with `var2`.

- The variable is never set and is referenced exactly once. In this
  case, the reference is substituted with the variable initial
  value.

Since it is especially useful to be able to get the arguments to a
function, argument variables are treated specially when the [`speed`][5ca8]
optimization quality is less than 3 and the `debug` quality is at
least 1. With this compilation policy, the values of argument
variables are almost always available everywhere in the function,
even at unknown locations. For non-argument variables, `debug` must be
at least 2 for values to be available, and even then, values are
only available at known locations.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40NOTE-ON-LEXICAL-VARIABLE-ACCESS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 5.4.2 Note On Lexical Variable Access

When the debugger command loop establishes variable bindings for
available variables, these variable bindings have lexical scope and
dynamic extent. You can close over them, but such closures can't be
used as upward function arguments.

> *Note*: The variable bindings are actually created using the Lisp
> [`symbol-macrolet`][2eec] special form.

You can also set local variables using [`setq`][0160], but if the variable was
closed over in the original source and never set, then setting the
variable in the debugger may not change the value in all the
functions the variable is defined in. Another risk of setting
variables is that you may assign a value of a type that the compiler
proved the variable could never take on. This may result in bad
things happening.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SOURCE-LOCATION-PRINTING-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 5.5 Source Location Printing

One of the debugger's capabilities is source level debugging of
compiled code.  These commands display the source location for the
current frame:

- `source [<context>]`: This command displays the file that the
  current frame's function was defined from (if it was defined from
  a file), and then the source form responsible for generating the
  code that the current frame was executing. If `<context>` is
  specified, then it is an integer specifying the number of
  enclosing levels of list structure to print.

The source form for a location in the code is the innermost list
present in the original source that encloses the form responsible
for generating that code. If the actual source form is not a list,
then some enclosing list will be printed. For example, if the source
form was a reference to the variable `*some-random-special*`, then
the innermost enclosing evaluated form will be printed. Here are
some possible enclosing forms:

    (let ((a *some-random-special*))
      ...)
    
    (+ *some-random-special* ...)

If the code at a location was generated from the expansion of a
macro or a source-level compiler optimization, then the form in the
original source that expanded into that code will be printed.
Suppose the file `/usr/me/mystuff.lisp` looked like this:

    (defmacro mymac ()
      '(myfun))
    
    (defun foo ()
      (mymac)
      ...)

If `foo` has called `myfun`, and is waiting for it to return, then
the `source` command would print:

    ; File: /usr/me/mystuff.lisp
    
    (MYMAC)

Note that the macro use was printed, not the actual function call form,
`(myfun)`.

If enclosing source is printed by giving an argument to `source` or
`vsource`, then the actual source form is marked by wrapping it in a
list whose first element is `#:***here***`. In the previous example,
`source 1` would print:

    ; File: /usr/me/mystuff.lisp
    
    (DEFUN FOO ()
      (#:***HERE***
       (MYMAC))
      ...)


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40HOW-THE-SOURCE-IS-FOUND-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 5.5.1 How the Source is Found

If the code was defined from Lisp by [`compile`][bc41] or [`eval`][0d6e], then the source
can always be reliably located. If the code was defined from a FASL
file created by [`compile-file`][0b69], then the debugger gets the source
forms it prints by reading them from the original source file. This
is a potential problem, since the source file might have moved or
changed since the time it was compiled.

The source file is opened using the [`truename`][ab6d] of the source file
pathname originally given to the compiler. This is an absolute
pathname with all logical names and symbolic links expanded. If the
file can't be located using this name, then the debugger gives up
and signals an error.

If the source file can be found, but has been modified since the time it was
compiled, the debugger prints this warning:

    ; File has been modified since compilation:
    ;   <filename>
    ; Using form offset instead of character position.

where `<filename>` is the name of the source file. It then proceeds
using a robust but not foolproof heuristic for locating the source.
This heuristic works if:

- No top-level forms before the top-level form containing the source
  have been added or deleted, and

- the top-level form containing the source has not been modified
  much. (More precisely, none of the list forms beginning before the
  source form have been added or deleted.)

If the heuristic doesn't work, the displayed source will be wrong,
but will probably be near the actual source. If the "shape" of the
top-level form in the source file is too different from the original
form, then an error will be signaled. When the heuristic is used,
the source location commands are noticeably slowed.

Source location printing can also be confused if (after the source
was compiled) a read-macro you used in the code was redefined to
expand into something different, or if a read-macro ever returns the
same [`eq`][5a82] list twice. If you don't define read macros and don't use
`##` in perverted ways, you don't need to worry about this.

#### 5.5.2 Source Location Availability

Source location information is only available when the debug
optimization quality is at least 2. If source location information
is unavailable, the source commands will give an error message.

If source location information is available, but the source location
is unknown because of an interrupt or unexpected hardware error
(see [Unknown Locations and Interrupts][2496]), then the command will
print

    Unknown location: using block start.

and then proceed to print the source location for the start of the
*@BASIC-BLOCK* enclosing the code location. It's a bit complicated to
explain exactly what a basic block is, but here are some properties
of the block start location:

- The block start location may be the same as the true location.

- The block start location will never be later in the program's flow
  of control than the true location.

- No conditional control structures (such as [`if`][02ad], [`cond`][5854], [`or`][8808]) will
  intervene between the block start and the true location (but note
  that some conditionals present in the original source could be
  optimized away.) Function calls *do not* end basic blocks.

- The head of a loop will be the start of a block.

- The programming language concept of block structure and the Lisp
  [`block`][d2d8] special form are totally unrelated to the compiler's basic
  block.

In other words, the true location lies between the printed location
and the next conditional (but watch out because the compiler may
have changed the program on you.)

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DEBUGGER-POLICY-CONTROL-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 5.6 Debugger Policy Control

The compilation policy specified by [`optimize`][4d51] declarations
affects the behavior seen in the debugger. The debug quality
directly affects the debugger by controlling the amount of debugger
information dumped. Other optimization qualities have indirect but
observable effects due to changes in the way compilation is done.

Unlike the other optimization qualities (which are compared in
relative value to evaluate tradeoffs), the [`debug`][5df9] optimization
quality is directly translated to a level of debug information. This
absolute interpretation allows the user to count on a particular
amount of debug information being available even when the values of
the other qualities are changed during compilation. These are the
levels of debug information that correspond to the values of the
`debug` quality:

- `0`: Only the function name and enough information to allow the
  stack to be parsed.

- `> 0`: Any level greater than 0 gives level 0 plus all argument
  variables. Values will only be accessible if the argument variable
  is never set and [`speed`][5ca8] is not 3. SBCL allows any real value for
  optimization qualities. It may be useful to specify 0.5 to get
  backtrace argument display without argument documentation.

- `1`: Level 1 provides argument documentation (printed argument
  lists) and derived argument/result type information. This makes
  [`describe`][6651] more informative, and allows the compiler to do
  compile-time argument count and type checking for any calls
  compiled at run-time. This is the default.

- `2`: Level 1 plus all interned local variables, source location
  information, and lifetime information that tells the debugger when
  arguments are available (even when `speed` is 3 or the argument is
  set).

- `> 2`: Any level greater than 2 gives level 2 and in addition
  disables tail-call optimization, so that the backtrace will
  contain frames for all invoked functions, even those in tail
  positions.

- `3`: Level 2 plus all uninterned variables. In addition, lifetime
  analysis is disabled (even when `speed` is 3), ensuring that all
  variable values are available at any known location within the
  scope of the binding. This has a speed penalty in addition to the
  obvious space penalty.

Inlining of local functions is inhibited so that they may be [`trace`][548d]d.

- `> (max speed space)`: If `debug` is greater than both `speed` and
  [`space`][4e8c], the command [`return`][5b0b] can be used to continue execution by
  returning a value from the current stack frame.

- `> (max speed space compilation-speed)`: If `debug` is greater than
  all of `speed`, `space` and [`compilation-speed`][705f] the code will be
  steppable (see [Single Stepping][d3f5]).

As you can see, if the `speed` quality is 3, debugger performance is
degraded. This effect comes from the elimination of argument
variable special-casing (see [Variable Value Availability][1298]). Some
degree of speed/debuggability tradeoff is unavoidable, but the
effect is not too drastic when `debug` is at least 2.

In addition to [`inline`][9fb4] and [`notinline`][9514] declarations, the relative
values of the `speed` and `space` qualities also change whether
functions are inline expanded. If a function is inline expanded,
then there will be no frame to represent the call, and the arguments
will be treated like any other local variable. Functions may also be
*@SEMI-INLINE*, in which case there is a frame to represent the
call, but the call is to an optimized local version of the function,
not to the original function.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40EXITING-COMMANDS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 5.7 Exiting Commands

These commands get you out of the debugger.

- `toplevel`: Throw to top level.

- `restart [<n>]`: Invoke the `<n>`th restart case as displayed by
  the [`error`][669b] command. If `<n>` is not specified, the available
  restart cases are reported.

- `continue`: Call [`continue`][87a5] on the condition given to [`debug`][5df9]. If
  there is no restart case named `continue`, then an error is
  signaled.

- `abort`: Call [`abort`][a838] on the condition given to `debug`. This is
  useful for popping debug command loop levels or aborting to top
  level, as the case may be.

- `return <value>`: Return `value` from the current stack frame.
  This command is available when the `debug` optimization quality is
  greater than both [`speed`][5ca8] and [`space`][4e8c]. Care must be taken that the
  value is of the same type as SBCL expects the stack frame to
  return.

- `restart-frame`: Restart execution of the current stack frame.
  This command is available when the `debug` optimization quality is
  greater than both `speed` and `space` and when the frame is for a
  global function. If the function is redefined in the debugger
  before the frame is restarted, the new function will be used.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40INFORMATION-COMMANDS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 5.8 Information Commands

Most of these commands print information about the current frame or
function, but a few show general information.

- `help` or `?`: Display a synopsis of debugger commands.

- `describe`: Call [`describe`][6651] on the current function and displays the
  number of local variables.

- `print`: Display the current function call as it would be
  displayed by moving to this frame.

- `error`: Print the condition given to [`invoke-debugger`][de5c] and the
  active proceed cases.

- `backtrace [<n>]`: Display all the frames from the current to the
  bottom. Only shows `<n>` frames if specified. The printing is
  controlled by [`sb-debug:*debug-print-variable-alist*`][21be].


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40BREAKPOINT-COMMANDS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 5.9 Breakpoint Commands

SBCL supports setting of breakpoints inside compiled functions and
stepping of compiled code. Breakpoints can only be set at known
locations (see [Unknown Locations and Interrupts][2496]), so these commands
are largely useless unless the [`debug`][5df9] optimize quality is at least
2 (see [Debugger Policy Control][faf1]). These commands manipulate
breakpoints:

- `breakpoint <location> [<option> <value>]*`: Set a breakpoint in
  some function. `<location>` may be an integer code location
  number (as displayed by `list-locations`) or a keyword. The
  keyword can be used to indicate setting a breakpoint at the
  function start (`:start`, `:s`) or function end (`:end`, `:e`). The
  `breakpoint` command has `:condition`, `:break`, `:print` and `:function`
  options which work similarly to the [`trace`][548d] options.

- `list-locations [<function>]` or `ll [<function>]`: List all the
  code locations in the current frame's function, or in `<function>`
  if it is supplied. The display format is the code location number,
  a colon and then the source form for that location:

        3: (1- N)

    If consecutive locations have the same source, then a numeric
    range like `3-5:` will be printed. For example, a default
    function call has a known location both immediately before and
    after the call, which would result in two code locations with
    the same source. The listed function becomes the new default
    function for breakpoint setting (via the `breakpoint`) command.

- `list-breakpoints` or `lb`: List all currently active breakpoints
  with their breakpoint number.

- `delete-breakpoint [<number>]` or `db [<number>]`: Delete a
  breakpoint specified by its breakpoint number. If no number is
  specified, delete all breakpoints.

- `step*`: Step to the next possible breakpoint location in the
  current function. This always steps over function calls, instead
  of stepping into them.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40BREAKPOINT-EXAMPLE-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 5.9.1 Breakpoint Example

Consider this definition of the factorial function:

    (defun ! (n)
      (if (zerop n)
          1
          (* n (! (1- n)))))

This debugger session demonstrates the use of breakpoints:

    * (break)  ; invoke debugger
    
    debugger invoked on a SIMPLE-CONDITION in thread 11184: break
    
    restarts (invokable by number or by possibly-abbreviated name):
      0: [CONTINUE] Return from BREAK.
      1: [ABORT   ] Reduce debugger level (leaving debugger, returning to toplevel).
      2: [TOPLEVEL] Restart at toplevel READ/EVAL/PRINT loop.
    ("varargs entry for top level local call BREAK" "break")
    0] ll #'!
    
    0-1: (SB-INT:NAMED-LAMBDA ! (N) (BLOCK ! (IF (ZEROP N) 1 (* N (! #)))))
    2: (BLOCK ! (IF (ZEROP N) 1 (* N (! (1- N)))))
    3: (ZEROP N)
    4: (* N (! (1- N)))
    5: (1- N)
    6: (! (1- N))
    7-8: (* N (! (1- N)))
    9-10: (IF (ZEROP N) 1 (* N (! (1- N))))
    0] br 4
    
    (* N (! (1- N)))
    1: 4 in !
    added
    0] toplevel
    
    > (! 10) ; Call the function
    
    *Breakpoint hit*
    
    Restarts:
      0: [CONTINUE] Return from BREAK.
      1: [ABORT   ] Return to Top-Level.
    
    Debug  (type H for help)
    
    (! 10) ; We are now in first call (arg 10) before the multiply
    Source: (* N (! (1- N)))
    3] step*
    
    *Step*
    
    (! 10) ; We have finished evaluation of (1- n)
    Source: (1- N)
    3] step*
    
    *Breakpoint hit*
    
    Restarts:
      0: [CONTINUE] Return from BREAK.
      1: [ABORT   ] Return to Top-Level.
    
    Debug  (type H for help)
    
    (! 9) ; We hit the breakpoint in the recursive call
    Source: (* N (! (1- N)))
    3]

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40FUNCTION-TRACING-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 5.10 Function Tracing

The tracer causes selected functions to print their arguments and
their results whenever they are called.  Options allow conditional
printing of the trace information and conditional breakpoints on
function entry or exit.

In SBCL, tracing can be done either by temporarily redefining the
function name (encapsulation), or using breakpoints. When
breakpoints are used, the function object itself is destructively
modified to cause the tracing action. The advantage of using
breakpoints is that tracing works even when the function is
anonymously called via [`funcall`][03c7], that function object identity is
preserved, and that anonymous and local functions can also be
traced.

<a id="x-28TRACE-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **trace** *&rest specs*

    `trace` `{Option Global-Value}* {Name {Option Value}*}*`
    
    `trace` is a debugging tool that provides information when specified
    functions are called. In its simplest form:
    
        (TRACE NAME-1 NAME-2 ...)
    
    The `name`s are not evaluated. Each may be one of the following:
    
    - [`symbol`][e5af], denoting a function or macro.
    
    - `fname`, a valid function name, denoting a function.
    
    - `(method fname qualifiers* (specializers*))` denoting a method.
    
    - `(compiler-macro symbol)` denoting a compiler macro.
    
    - `(labels fname :in outer-name)` or `(flet fname :in outer-name)`
      denoting a local function where `outer-name` may be any of the
      previous names for functions, macros, methods or compiler macros.
      Tracing local functions may require [`debug`][5df9] policy 3 to inhibit
      inlining.
    
    - [`string`][68cc] denoting all functions fbound to symbols whose home package
      is the package with the given name.
    
    Options allow modification of the default behavior. Each option is a
    pair of an option keyword and a value form. Global options are
    specified before the first name, and affect all functions traced by a
    given use of `trace`. Options may also be interspersed with function
    names, in which case they act as local options, only affecting tracing
    of the immediately preceding function name. Local options override
    global options.
    
    By default, `trace` causes a printout on [`*trace-output*`][2243] each time that
    one of the named functions is entered or returns. (This is the basic,
    ANSI Common Lisp behavior of `trace`.)
    
    The following options are defined:
    
    - `:report` `<report-type>`
    
        If `report-type` is `trace` (the default) then information is
        reported by printing immediately. If `report-type` is `nil`, then
        the only effect of the trace is to execute other options (e.g.
        [`print`][d451] or [`break`][7598]). Otherwise, `report-type` is treated as a function
        designator and, for each trace event, funcalled with 5 arguments:
        trace depth (a non-negative integer), a function name or a
        function object, a keyword (`:enter`, `:exit` or `:non-local-exit`), a
        stack frame, and a list of values (arguments or return values).
    
    - `:condition` `<form>`
    
    - `:condition-after` `<form>`
    
    - `:condition-all` `<form>`
    
        If `:condition` is specified, then `trace` does nothing unless `form`
        evaluates to true at the time of the call. `:condition-after` is
        similar, but suppresses the initial printout, and is tested when
        the function returns. `:condition-all` tries both before and after.
    
    - `:break` `<form>`
    
    - `:break-after` `<form>`
    
    - `:break-all` `<form>`
    
        If specified, and `form` evaluates to true, then the debugger is
        invoked at the start of the function, at the end of the function,
        or both, according to the respective option.
    
    - `:print` `<form>`
    
    - `:print-after` `<form>`
    
    - `:print-all` `<form>`
    
        In addition to the usual printout, the result of evaluating `form`
        is printed at the start of the function, at the end of the
        function, or both, according to the respective option. Multiple
        print options cause multiple values to be printed.
    
    - `:wherein` `<names>`
    
        If specified, `names` is a function name or list of names. `trace`
        does nothing unless a call to one of those functions encloses the
        call to this function (i.e. it would appear in a backtrace.)
        Anonymous functions have string names like "[`defun`][f472] FOO".
    
    - `:encapsulate` {`:default` | `t` | `nil`}
    
        If `t`, the default, tracing is done via encapsulation (redefining
        the function name) rather than by modifying the function. `:default`
        is not the default but means to use encapsulation for interpreted
        functions and funcallable instances, breakpoints otherwise. When
        encapsulation is used, forms are *not* evaluated in the function's
        lexical environment, but `sb-debug:arg` can still be used.
    
    - `:methods` {`t` | `nil`}
    
        If `t`, any function argument naming a generic function will have
        its methods traced in addition to the generic function itself.
    
    - `:function` `<function-form>`
    
        This is a not really an option but rather another way of
        specifying what function to trace. The `function-form` is
        evaluated immediately, and the resulting function is traced.
    
    `:condition`, `:break` and `:print` forms are evaluated in a context which
    mocks up the lexical environment of the called function, so that
    [`sb-debug:var`][a625] and `sb-debug:arg` can be used.
    The `*-after` and `*-all` forms can use also use `sb-debug:arg`. In forms
    which are evaluated after the function call, `(sb-debug:arg n)` returns
    the `n`th value returned by the function.

    Also, see the [CLHS][10c3].

In the case of functions where the known return convention is used
to optimize, encapsulation may be necessary in order to make tracing
work at all. The symptom of this occurring is an error stating

    Error in function FOO: :FUNCTION-END breakpoints are
    currently unsupported for the known return convention.

in such cases we recommend using `(TRACE FOO :ENCAPSULATE t)`.

<a id="x-28UNTRACE-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **untrace** *&rest specs*

    Remove tracing from the specified functions. Untraces all
    functions when called with no arguments.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SINGLE-STEPPING-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 5.11 Single Stepping

SBCL includes an instrumentation based single-stepper for compiled
code, that can be invoked via the [`step`][aea4] macro, or from within the
debugger. See [Debugger Policy Control][faf1], for details on enabling
stepping for compiled code.

The following debugger commands are used for controlling single stepping.

- `start`: Select the [`continue`][1867] restart if one exists and starts
  single stepping. None of the other single stepping commands can be
  used before stepping has been started either by using `start` or
  by using the standard [`step`][aea4] macro.

- `step`: Step into the current form. Stepping will be resumed when
  the next form that has been compiled with stepper instrumentation
  is evaluated.

- `next`: Step over the current form. Stepping will be disabled
  until evaluation of the form is complete.

- `out`: Step out of the current frame. Stepping will be disabled
  until the topmost stack frame that had been stepped into returns.

- `stop`: Stop the single stepper and resumes normal execution.


<a id="x-28STEP-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **step** *form*

    The form is evaluated with single stepping enabled. Function calls
    outside the lexical scope of the form can be stepped into only if the
    functions in question have been compiled with sufficient [`debug`][5df9] policy
    to be at least partially steppable.

    Also, see the [CLHS][e725].

### 5.12 Enabling and Disabling the Debugger

In certain contexts (e.g. non-interactive applications), it may be
desirable to turn off the SBCL debugger (and possibly re-enable it).
The functions here control the debugger.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ADISABLE-DEBUGGER-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:disable-debugger**

    When invoked, this function will turn off both the SBCL debugger
    and [`ldb`][00e9] (the low-level debugger).  See also [`enable-debugger`][adab].

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AENABLE-DEBUGGER-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:enable-debugger**

    Restore the debugger if it has been turned off by [`disable-debugger`][356e].

## 6 Efficiency

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SLOT-ACCESS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 6.1 Slot Access

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40STRUCTURE-OBJECT-SLOT-ACCESS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 6.1.1 Structure Object Slot Access

Structure slot accessors are efficient only if the compiler is
able to open code them: compiling a call to a structure slot
accessor before the structure is defined, declaring one [`notinline`][9514],
or passing it as a functional argument to another function causes
severe performance degradation.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40STANDARD-OBJECT-SLOT-ACCESS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 6.1.2 Standard Object Slot Access

The most efficient way to access a slot of a [`standard-object`][a843] is
by using [`slot-value`][5a85] with a constant slot name argument inside a
[`defmethod`][6832] body, where the variable holding the instance is a
specializer parameter of the method and is never assigned to. The
cost is roughly 1.6 times that of an open coded structure slot
accessor.

Second most efficient way is to use a CLOS slot accessor, or
`slot-value` with a constant slot name argument, but in circumstances
other than specified above. This may be up to 3 times as slow as the
method described above.

Example:

    (defclass foo () ((bar)))
    
    ;; Fast: specializer and never assigned to
    (defmethod quux ((foo foo) new)
      (let ((old (slot-value foo 'bar)))
        (setf (slot-value foo 'bar) new)
        old))
    
    ;; Slow: not a specializer
    (defmethod quux ((foo foo) new)
      (let* ((temp foo)
             (old (slot-value temp 'bar)))
        (setf (slot-value temp 'bar) new)
        old))
    
    ;; Slow: assignment to FOO
    (defmethod quux ((foo foo) new)
      (let ((old (slot-value foo 'bar)))
        (setf (slot-value foo 'bar) new)
        (setf foo new)
        old))

Note that when profiling code such as this, the first few calls to the
generic function are not representative, as the dispatch mechanism is
lazily set up during those calls.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40STACK-ALLOCATION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 6.2 Stack Allocation

SBCL has fairly extensive support for performing allocations on the
stack when a variable or function is declared [`dynamic-extent`][0901]. The
`dynamic-extent` declarations are not verified but are simply trusted
as long as [`sb-ext:*stack-allocate-dynamic-extent*`][76b5] is true.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2ASTACK-ALLOCATE-DYNAMIC-EXTENT-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*stack-allocate-dynamic-extent\*** *t*

    If true (the default), the compiler believes [`dynamic-extent`][0901] declarations
    and stack allocates otherwise inaccessible parts of the object whenever
    possible.

SBCL recognizes any value which a variable declared [`dynamic-extent`][0901]
can take on as having dynamic extent. This means that, in addition
to the value a variable is bound to initially, a value assigned to a
variable by [`setq`][0160] is also recognized as having dynamic extent when
the variable is declared `dynamic-extent`. Users can thus build
complex structures on the stack using iteration and `setq`.

At present, SBCL implements stack allocation for the following kinds
of values when they are recognized as having dynamic extent:

- [`&rest`][4336] lists;

- the results of [`cons`][229c], [`list`][9271], [`list*`][f275], and [`vector`][64b3];

- the result of simple forms of [`make-array`][92ab]: stack allocation is
  possible only if the resulting array is known to be both simple
  and one-dimensional, and has a constant `:element-type`;

    > **Warning**: Stack space is limited, so allocation of a large
    > vector may cause stack overflow. Stack overflow checks are
    > done except in 0 safety policies.

- closures defined with [`flet`][091c] or [`labels`][c2ef] with a bound [`dynamic-extent`][0901]
  declaration;

- anonymous closures defined with [`lambda`][650d];

- user-defined structures when the structure constructor defined using
  [`defstruct`][eac1] has been declared [`inline`][9fb4];

    > *Note*: Structures with *raw* slots can currently be
    > stack-allocated only on x86 and x86-64. A raw slot is one
    > whose declared type is a subtype of exactly one of:
    > [`double-float`][0d57], [`single-float`][31a6], `(complex
    > double-float)`, `(complex single-float)`, or `sb-ext:word`; but
    > as an exception to the preceding, any subtype of [`fixnum`][3cde] is not
    > stored as raw despite also being a subtype of `sb-ext:word`.

- otherwise-inaccessible parts of objects recognized to be dynamic
  extent. The support for detecting when this applies is very
  sophisticated. The compiler can do this detection when any value
  form for a variable contains conditional allocations, function
  calls, inlined functions, anonymous closures, or even other
  variables. This allows stack allocation of complex structures.

Examples:

    ;;; Declaiming a structure constructor inline before definition makes
    ;;; stack allocation possible.
    (declaim (inline make-thing))
    (defstruct thing obj next)
    
    ;;; Stack allocation of various objects bound to DYNAMIC-EXTENT
    ;;; variables.
    (let* ((list (list 1 2 3))
           (nested (cons (list 1 2) (list* 3 4 (list 5))))
           (vector (make-array 3 :element-type 'single-float))
           (thing (make-thing :obj list
                              :next (make-thing :obj (make-array 3))))
           (closure (let ((y ...)) (lambda () y))))
      (declare (dynamic-extent list nested vector thing closure))
      ...)
    
    ;;; Stack allocation of objects assigned to DYNAMIC-EXTENT variables.
    (let ((x nil))
      (declare (dynamic-extent x))
      (setq x (list 1 2 3))
      (dotimes (i 10)
        (setq x (cons i x)))
      ...)
    
    ;;; Stack allocation of arguments to a local function is equivalent
    ;;; to stack allocation of local variable values.
    (flet ((f (x)
             (declare (dynamic-extent x))
             ...))
      ...
      (f (list 1 2 3))
      (f (cons (cons 1 2) (cons 3 4)))
      ...)
    
    ;;; Stack allocation of &REST lists
    (defun foo (&rest args)
      (declare (dynamic-extent args))
      ...)

As a notable exception to recognizing otherwise inaccessible parts
of other recognized dynamic extent values, SBCL does not as of
1.0.48.21 propagate dynamic-extentness through [`&rest`][4336] arguments --
but another conforming implementation might, so portable code should
not rely on this.

    (declaim (inline foo))
    (defun foo (fun &rest arguments)
      (declare (dynamic-extent arguments))
      (apply fun arguments))
    
    (defun bar (a)
      ;; SBCL will heap allocate the result of (LIST A), and stack
      ;; allocate only the spine of the &rest list -- so this is
      ;; safe but unportable.
      ;;
      ;; Another implementation, including earlier versions of SBCL
      ;; might consider (LIST A) to be otherwise inaccessible and
      ;; stack-allocate it as well!
      (foo #'car (list a)))

If dynamic extent constraints specified in the Common Lisp standard
are violated, the best that can happen is for the program to have
garbage in variables and return values; more commonly, the system
will crash.

In particular, it is important to realize that this can interact in
suprising ways with the otherwise inaccessible parts criterion:

    (let* ((a (list 1 2 3))
           (b (cons a a)))
       (declare (dynamic-extent b))
       ;; Unless A is accessed elsewhere as well, SBCL will consider
       ;; it to be otherwise inaccessible -- it can only be accessed
       ;; through B, after all -- and stack allocate it as well.
       ;;
       ;; Hence returning (CAR B) here is unsafe.
       ...)

SBCL also performs sophisticated escape analysis to enable automatic
stack allocation of local functions without any bound dynamic extent
declarations in many situations where the compiler can prove that no
uses escape (traditional Lisp terminology names this situation "all
uses are downward funargs"). For example, in the following
function, the local function `#'predicatep` is stack allocated,
because the compiler understands that the built-in function
[`position-if`][abd8] only uses its first argument as a downward funarg:

    (let ((acc 0))
      (flet ((predicatep (num) (plusp (+ num off))))
        (dotimes (i 10)
          (incf acc (position-if #'predicatep array)))
        (if (plusp off)
            (incf acc (if (positivep acc) 10 3))
            (incf acc (position-if #'predicatep array))))
      acc)

Users can also declare that their own functions take downward
funargs by adding bound dynamic extent declarations on the function
arguments.

    (defun trivial-hof (fun arg)
      (declare (dynamic-extent fun))
      (funcall fun 3 arg))

Currently, such dynamic extent declarations only cause stack
allocation of downward funargs at call sites on sufficiently unsafe
policy. This is partly because the compiler is currently not able to
detect incorrect usage of dynamic extent declarations.

    (defun autodxclosure1 (&optional (x 4))
      ;; Calling a higher-order function will only implicitly
      ;; stack-allocate a funarg if the callee is trusted (a CL:
      ;; function) or the caller is unsafe.
      (declare (optimize speed (safety 0) (debug 0)))
      (trivial-hof (lambda (a b) (+ a b x)) 92))

### 6.3 Modular Arithmetic

Some numeric functions have a property: n lower bits of the
result depend only on n lower bits of (all or some) arguments. If
the compiler sees an expression of form `(logand <expr> <mask>)`,
where `<expr>` is a tree of such *good* functions and `<mask>` is
known to be of type `(unsigned-byte <w>)`, where `<w>` is a *good*
width, all intermediate results will be cut to `<w>` bits (but it is
not done for variables and constants!). This often results in an
ability to use simple machine instructions for the functions.

Consider this example:

    (defun i (x y)
      (declare (type (unsigned-byte 32) x y))
      (ldb (byte 32 0) (logxor x (lognot y))))

The result of `(lognot y)` will be negative and of type
`(signed-byte 33)`, so a naive implementation on a 32-bit platform
is unable to use 32-bit arithmetic here. But modular arithmetic
optimizer is able to do it: because the result is cut down to 32
bits, the compiler will replace [`logxor`][aa84] and [`lognot`][edce] with versions
cutting results to 32 bits, and because terminals (here, expressions
`x` and `y`) are also of type `(unsigned-byte 32)`, 32-bit machine
arithmetic can be used.

As of SBCL 0.8.5 good functions are [`+`][0c83], [`-`][2dd9], [`logand`][7ab4], [`logior`][0430],
`logxor`, `lognot` and their combinations; and [`ash`][90ca] with the positive
second argument. Good widths are 32 on 32-bit CPUs and 64 on 64-bit
CPUs. While it is possible to support smaller widths as well,
currently this is not implemented.

#### 6.3.1 Signed Modular Arithmetic

Sign-extending the result in the following way will be
translated into signed modular arithmetic:

    (defun add (a b)
      (declare (type (signed-byte 64) a b))
      (let ((u (ldb (byte 64 0) (+ a b))))
        (logior u (- (mask-field (byte 1 63) u)))))


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40RECOGNIZED-IDIOMS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 6.4 Recognized Idioms

Common Lisp doesn't directly expose all features present in
modern hardware. Some code patterns are recognized and turned into
more efficient hardware instructions without requiring the use of
internal features.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40COUNT-TRAILING-ZEROS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 6.4.1 Count Trailing Zeros

    (defun ctz (n)
      (declare (type (unsigned-byte 64) n))
      (integer-length (ldb (byte 64 0) (lognor n (- n)))))

is turned into hardware instructions on arm64 and x86-64. It returns
64 when `n` is 0. `n` can also be `(signed-byte 64)` or [`fixnum`][3cde].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40GLOBAL-AND-ALWAYS-BOUND-VARIABLES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 6.5 Global and Always-bound Variables

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ADEFGLOBAL-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-ext:defglobal** *name value &optional doc*

    Defines `name` as a global variable that is always bound. `value` is evaluated
    and assigned to `name` both at compile- and load-time, but only if `name` is not
    already bound.
    
    Global variables share their values between all threads, and cannot be
    locally bound, declared special, defined as constants, and neither bound
    nor defined as symbol macros.
    
    See also the declarations [`sb-ext:global`][fcab] and [`sb-ext:always-bound`][db0e].

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AGLOBAL-20DECLARATION-29"></a>

- [declaration] **sb-ext:global**

    Syntax: `(sb-ext:global &rest symbols)`
    
    Only valid as a global proclamation.
    
    Specifies that the named symbols cannot be proclaimed or locally
    declared [`special`][0bd4]. Proclaiming an already special or constant variable
    name as `sb-ext:global` signal an error. Allows more efficient value
    lookup in threaded environments in addition to expressing programmer
    intention.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AALWAYS-BOUND-20DECLARATION-29"></a>

- [declaration] **sb-ext:always-bound**

    Syntax: `(sb-ext:always-bound &rest symbols)`
    
    Only valid as a global proclamation.
    
    Specifies that the named symbols are always bound. Inhibits [`makunbound`][35b1]
    of the named symbols. Proclaiming an unbound symbol as
    `sb-ext:always-bound` signals an error. Allows the compiler to elide
    boundness checks from value lookups.

### 6.6 Miscellaneous Efficiency Issues

FIXME: The material in the CMUCL manual about getting good
performance from the compiler should be reviewed, reformatted in
Texinfo, lightly edited for SBCL, and substituted into this
manual. In the meantime, the original CMUCL manual is still 95+%
correct for the SBCL version of the Python compiler. See the
sections

- Advanced Compiler Use and Efficiency Hints

- Advanced Compiler Introduction

- More About Types in Python

- Type Inference

- Source Optimization

- Tail Recursion

- Local Call

- Block Compilation

- Inline Expansion

- Object Representation

- Numbers

- General Efficiency Hints

- Efficiency Notes

Besides this information from the CMUCL manual, there are a few other
points to keep in mind.

- The CMUCL manual doesn't seem to state it explicitly, but Python
  has a mental block about type inference when assignment is
  involved. Python is very aggressive and clever about inferring the
  types of values bound with [`let`][4853], [`let*`][49f5], inline function call, and so
  forth. However, it's much more passive and dumb about inferring
  the types of values assigned with [`setq`][0160], [`setf`][a138], and friends. It
  would be nice to fix this, but in the meantime don't expect that
  just because it's very smart about types in most respects it will
  be smart about types involved in assignments. (This doesn't affect
  its ability to benefit from explicit type declarations involving
  the assigned variables, only its ability to get by without
  explicit type declarations.)


- Since the time the CMUCL manual was written, CMUCL (and thus SBCL)
  has gotten a generational GC. This means that there are some
  efficiency implications of various patterns of memory usage which
  aren't discussed in the CMUCL manual. (Some new material should be
  written about this.)

- SBCL has some important known efficiency problems. Perhaps the
  most important are

    - The garbage collector is not particularly efficient, at least
      on platforms without the generational collector (as of SBCL
      0.8.9, all except x86).

    - Various aspects of the PCL implementation of CLOS are more
      inefficient than necessary.

Finally, note that Common Lisp defines many constructs which, in the
infamous phrase, "could be compiled efficiently by a sufficiently
smart compiler". The phrase is infamous because making a compiler
which actually is sufficiently smart to find all these optimizations
systematically is well beyond the state of the art of current
compiler technology. Instead, they're optimized on a case-by-case
basis by hand-written code, or not optimized at all if the
appropriate case hasn't been hand-coded. Some cases where no such
hand-coding has been done as of SBCL version 0.6.3 include

- `(reduce #'f x)` where the type of `x` is known at compile time,

- various bit vector operations, e.g. `(position 0 some-bit-vector)`,

- specialized sequence idioms, e.g. `(remove item list :count 1)`,

- cases where local compilation policy does not require excessive
  type checking, e.g. `(locally (declare (safety 1)) (assoc item list))`
  (which currently performs safe [`endp`][e8d7] checking internal to [`assoc`][e5fc]).

If your system's performance is suffering because of some construct
which could in principle be compiled efficiently, but which the SBCL
compiler can't in practice compile efficiently, consider writing a
patch to the compiler and submitting it for inclusion in the main
sources. Such code is often reasonably straightforward to write;
search the sources for the string `deftransform` to find many
examples (some straightforward, some less so).

## 7 Beyond the ANSI Standard

SBCL is derived from CMUCL, which implements many extensions to the
ANSI standard. SBCL doesn't support as many extensions as CMUCL, but
it still has quite a few. See [Contributed Modules][6a68].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40READER-EXTENSIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 7.1 Reader Extensions

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40EXTENDED-PACKAGE-PREFIX-SYNTAX-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 7.1.1 Extended Package Prefix Syntax

SBCL supports extended package prefix syntax, which allows specifying
an alternate package instead of [`*package*`][5ed1] for the reader to use as
the default package for interning symbols:

    <package-name>::<form-with-interning-into-package>

Example:

    'foo::(bar quux zot) == '(foo::bar foo::quux foo::zot)

`*package*` is not rebound during the course of reading a form with
extended package prefix syntax; if `foo::bar` would cause a
read-time package lock violation, so does `foo::(bar)`.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SYMBOL-NAME-NORMALIZATION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 7.1.2 Symbol Name Normalization

SBCL also extends the reader to normalize all symbols to *Normalization
Form KC* in builds with Unicode enabled. Whether symbols are
normalized is controlled by

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AREADTABLE-NORMALIZATION-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:readtable-normalization** *readtable*

    Returns `t` if `readtable` normalizes symbols to NFKC, and `nil`
    otherwise. The `readtable-normalization` of the standard readtable is `t`.

Symbols created by [`intern`][b4f0] and similar functions are not affected by
this setting. If [`sb-ext:readtable-normalization`][9e48] is `t`, symbols that
are not normalized are escaped during printing.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DECIMAL-SYNTAX-FOR-RATIONALS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 7.1.3 Decimal Syntax for Rationals

SBCL supports a decimal syntax for rationals, modelled after the
standard syntax for floating-point numbers. If a number with
floating-point syntax has an exponent marker of `r` or `r`
(rather than one of the standard exponent markers), it is read as
the rational with the exact value of the decimal number expressed as
a float.

In addition, setting or binding the value of
[`*read-default-float-format*`][88f1] to [`rational`][f0444] around a call to [`read`][fe58] or
[`read-from-string`][d813] has the effect that floating-point numbers without
exponent markers are read as rational numbers, as if there had been
an explicit `r` or `r` marker.

Floating point numbers of all types are printed with an exponent
marker while the value of `*read-default-float-format*` is `rational`;
however, rational numbers are printed in their standard syntax,
irrespective of the value of `*read-default-float-format*`.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40PACKAGE-LOCAL-NICKNAMES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 7.2 Package-Local Nicknames

SBCL allows giving packages local nicknames: they allow short and
easy-to-use names to be used without fear of name conflict associated
with normal nicknames.

A local nickname is valid only when inside the package for which it
has been specified. Different packages can use same local nickname
for different global names, or different local nickname for same
global name.

The symbol `:package-local-nicknames` in [`*features*`][6234] denotes the
support for this feature.

[`defpackage`][9b43] options are extended to include

    :local-nicknames (<local-nickname> <actual-package-name>)*

with the semantics of adding the package package-local nicknames
`<local-nickname>`s for the corresponding `<actual-package-name>`s.

Example:

    (defpackage :bar (:intern "X"))
    (defpackage :foo (:intern "X"))
    (defpackage :quux (:use :cl) (:local-nicknames (:bar :foo) (:foo :bar)))
    (find-symbol "X" :foo) ; => FOO::X
    (find-symbol "X" :bar) ; => BAR::X
    (let ((*package* (find-package :quux)))
      (find-symbol "X" :foo))               ; => BAR::X
    (let ((*package* (find-package :quux)))
      (find-symbol "X" :bar))               ; => FOO::X


<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3APACKAGE-LOCAL-NICKNAMES-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:package-local-nicknames** *package-designator*

    Returns an alist of `(local-nickname . actual-package)` describing the
    nicknames local to the designated package.
    
    When in the designated package, calls to [`find-package`][4dc9] with the any of the
    local-nicknames will return the corresponding actual-package instead. This
    also affects all implied calls to `find-package`, including those performed by
    the reader.
    
    When printing a package prefix for a symbol with a package local nickname, the
    local nickname is used instead of the real name in order to preserve
    print-read consistency.
    
    Experimental: interface subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3APACKAGE-LOCALLY-NICKNAMED-BY-LIST-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:package-locally-nicknamed-by-list** *package-designator*

    Returns a list of packages which have a local nickname for the designated
    package.
    
    Experimental: interface subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AADD-PACKAGE-LOCAL-NICKNAME-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:add-package-local-nickname** *local-nickname actual-package &optional (package-designator (sane-package))*

    Adds `local-nickname` for `actual-package` in the designated package, defaulting
    to current package. `local-nickname` must be a string designator, and
    `actual-package` must be a package designator.
    
    Returns the designated package.
    
    Signals a continuable error if `local-nickname` is already a package
    local nickname for a different package, or if `local-nickname` is one of
    `"CL"`, `"COMMON-LISP"`, `"KEYWORD"`, or if `local-nickname` is a
    global name or nickname for the package to which the nickname would be
    added.
    
    When in the designated package, calls to [`find-package`][4dc9] with the `local-nickname`
    will return the package the designated `actual-package` instead. This also
    affects all implied calls to `find-package`, including those performed by the
    reader.
    
    When printing a package prefix for a symbol with a package local nickname,
    local nickname is used instead of the real name in order to preserve
    print-read consistency.
    
    Experimental: interface subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AREMOVE-PACKAGE-LOCAL-NICKNAME-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:remove-package-local-nickname** *old-nickname &optional (package-designator (sane-package))*

    If the designated package had `old-nickname` as a local nickname for
    another package, it is removed. Returns true if the nickname existed and was
    removed, and `nil` otherwise.
    
    Experimental: interface subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40PACKAGE-VARIANCE-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 7.3 Package Variance

[`defpackage`][9b43] `clhs` specifies that *if the new definition is at
variance with the current state of that package, the consequences
are undefined*. SBCL by default signals a full warning and retains
as much of the package state as possible. This can be adjusted with
the following variable.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2AON-PACKAGE-VARIANCE-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*on-package-variance\*** *(:warn t)*

    Specifies behavior when redefining a package using [`defpackage`][9b43] and the
    definition is in variance with the current state of the package.
    
    The value should be of the form:
    
        (:warn [t | packages-names] :error [t | package-names])
    
    specifying which packages get which behaviour -- with `t` signifying the
    default unless otherwise specified. If default is not specified, `:warn`
    is used.
    
    - `:warn` keeps as much state as possible and causes SBCL to signal a
      full warning.
    
    - `:error` causes SBCL to signal an error when the variant `defpackage`
      form is executed, with restarts provided for user to specify what
      action should be taken.
    
    Example:
    
        (setf *on-package-variance* '(:warn (:swank :swank-backend) :error t))
    
    specifies to signal a warning if SWANK package is in variance, and an
    error otherwise.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40GARBAGE-COLLECTION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 7.4 Garbage Collection

SBCL provides additional garbage collection functionality not
specified by ANSI.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AGC-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:gc** *&key sb-kernel::full (gen 0) &allow-other-keys*

    Initiate a garbage collection.
    
    The default is to initiate a nursery collection, which may in turn
    trigger a collection of one or more older generations as well. If FULL
    is true, all generations are collected. If GEN is provided, it can be
    used to specify the oldest generation guaranteed to be collected.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2AAFTER-GC-HOOKS-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*after-gc-hooks\*** *nil*

    Called after each garbage collection, except for garbage collections
    triggered during thread exits. In a multithreaded environment these hooks may
    run in any thread.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40FINALIZATION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 7.4.1 Finalization

Finalization allows code to be executed after an object has been
garbage collected. This is useful for example for releasing foreign
memory associated with a Lisp object.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AFINALIZE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:finalize** *object function &key dont-save*

    Arrange for the designated `function` to be called when there
    are no more references to `object`, including references in `function`
    itself.
    
    If `dont-save` is true, the finalizer will be cancelled when
    [`save-lisp-and-die`][9e55] is called: this is useful for finalizers
    deallocating system memory, which might otherwise be called with
    addresses from the old image.
    
    In a multithreaded environment `function` may be called in any
    thread. In both single and multithreaded environments `function`
    may be called in any dynamic scope: consequences are unspecified
    if `function` is not fully re-entrant.
    
    Errors from `function` are handled and cause a [`warning`][bcb6] to be
    signalled in whichever thread the `function` was called in.
    
    Examples:
    
    ```
    ;;; GOOD, assuming RELEASE-HANDLE is re-entrant.
    (let* ((handle (get-handle))
           (object (make-object handle)))
     (finalize object (lambda () (release-handle handle)))
     object)
    ```
    
    ```
    ;;; BAD, finalizer refers to object being finalized, causing
    ;;; it to be retained indefinitely!
    (let* ((handle (get-handle))
           (object (make-object handle)))
      (finalize object
                (lambda ()
                  (release-handle (object-handle object)))))
    ```
    
    ```
    ;;; BAD, not re-entrant!
    (defvar *rec* nil)
    
    (defun oops ()
     (when *rec*
       (error "recursive OOPS"))
     (let ((*rec* t))
       (gc))) ; or just cons enough to cause one
    ```
    
    ```
    (progn
      (finalize "oops" #'oops)
      (oops)) ; GC causes re-entry to #'oops due to the finalizer
              ; -> ERROR, caught, WARNING signalled
    ```

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ACANCEL-FINALIZATION-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:cancel-finalization** *object*

    Cancel all finalizations for `object`, returning `t` if it had a finalizer.

#### 7.4.2 Weak Pointers

Weak pointers allow references to objects to be maintained without
keeping them from being garbage collected: useful for building caches
among other things.

Hash tables can also have weak keys and values. See
[Hash Table Extensions][309c].

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AMAKE-WEAK-POINTER-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:make-weak-pointer** *object*

    Allocate and return a weak pointer which points to `object`.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AWEAK-POINTER-VALUE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:weak-pointer-value** *weak-pointer*

    If `weak-pointer` is valid, return the value of `weak-pointer` and `t`.
    If the referent of `weak-pointer` has been garbage collected,
    returns the values `nil` and `nil`.

#### 7.4.3 Introspection and Tuning

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2AGC-RUN-TIME-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*gc-run-time\*** *0*

    Total CPU time spent doing garbage collection (as reported by
    [`get-internal-run-time`][e11a].) Initialized to zero on startup. It is safe to bind
    this to zero in order to measure [`gc`][b50b] time inside a certain section of code, but
    doing so may interfere with results reported by eg. [`time`][9427].

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2AGC-REAL-TIME-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*gc-real-time\*** *0*

    Total real time spent doing garbage collection (as reported by
    [`get-internal-real-time`][4912].) Initialized to zero on startup.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ABYTES-CONSED-BETWEEN-GCS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:bytes-consed-between-gcs**

    The amount of memory that will be allocated before the next garbage
    collection is initiated. This can be set with [`setf`][a138].
    
    On GENCGC platforms this is the nursery size, and defaults to 5% of dynamic
    space size.
    
    Note that currently, changes to this value are lost when saving core.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ADYNAMIC-SPACE-SIZE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:dynamic-space-size**

    Size of the dynamic space in bytes.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AGET-BYTES-CONSED-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:get-bytes-consed**

    Return the number of bytes consed since the program began. Typically
    this result will be a consed bignum, so if you have an
    application (e.g. profiling) which can't tolerate the overhead of
    consing bignums, you'll probably want either to hack in at a lower
    level (as the code in the `sb-profile` package does), or to design a
    more microefficient interface and submit it as a patch.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AGC-LOGFILE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:gc-logfile**

    Return the pathname used to log garbage collections. Can be [`setf`][a138].
    Default is `nil`, meaning collections are not logged. If non-null, the
    designated file is opened before and after each collection, and generation
    statistics are appended to it.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AGENERATION-AVERAGE-AGE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:generation-average-age** *generation*

    Average age of memory allocated to GENERATION: average number of times
    objects allocated to the generation have seen younger objects promoted to it.
    Available on GENCGC platforms only.
    
    Experimental: interface subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AGENERATION-BYTES-ALLOCATED-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:generation-bytes-allocated** *generation*

    Number of bytes allocated to GENERATION currently. Available on GENCGC
    platforms only.
    
    Experimental: interface subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AGENERATION-BYTES-CONSED-BETWEEN-GCS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:generation-bytes-consed-between-gcs** *generation*

    Number of bytes that can be allocated to GENERATION before that
    generation is considered for garbage collection. This value is meaningless for
    generation 0 (the nursery): see [`bytes-consed-between-gcs`][54ac] instead. Default is
    5% of the dynamic space size divided by the number of non-nursery generations.
    Can be assigned to using [`setf`][a138]. Available on GENCGC platforms only.
    
    Experimental: interface subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AGENERATION-MINIMUM-AGE-BEFORE-GC-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:generation-minimum-age-before-gc** *generation*

    Minimum average age of objects allocated to GENERATION before that
    generation is may be garbage collected. Default is 0.75. See also
    [`generation-average-age`][b1d89]. Can be assigned to using [`setf`][a138]. Available on GENCGC
    platforms only.
    
    Experimental: interface subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AGENERATION-NUMBER-OF-GCS-BEFORE-PROMOTION-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:generation-number-of-gcs-before-promotion** *generation*

    Number of times garbage collection is done on GENERATION before
    automatic promotion to the next generation is triggered. Default is 1. Can be
    assigned to using [`setf`][a138]. Available on GENCGC platforms only.
    
    Experimental: interface subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AGENERATION-NUMBER-OF-GCS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:generation-number-of-gcs** *generation*

    Number of times garbage collection has been done on GENERATION without
    promotion. Available on GENCGC platforms only.
    
    Experimental: interface subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40TRACING-LIVE-OBJECTS-BACK-TO-ROOTS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 7.4.4 Tracing Live Objects Back to Roots

This feature is intended to help expert users diagnose rare low-level
issues and should not be needed during normal usage. On top of that,
the interface and implementation are experimental and may change at
any time without further notice.

It is sometimes important to understand why a given object is
retained in the Lisp image instead of being garbage collected. To
help with this problem, SBCL provides a mechanism that searches
through the different memory spaces, builds a path of references
from a root to the object in question and finally reports this
paths:

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ASEARCH-ROOTS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:search-roots** *weak-pointers &key (criterion :oldest) (ignore '(\* \*\* \*\*\* / // ///)) (print t)*

    Find roots keeping the targets of `weak-pointers` alive.
    
    `weak-pointers` must be a single `sb-ext:weak-pointer` or a list of those,
    pointing to objects for which roots should be searched.
    
    `criterion` determines just how rooty (how deep) a root must be in order
    to be considered. Possible values are:
    
    - `:oldest`
    
        This says we can stop upon seeing an object in the oldest gen to
        [`gc`][b50b], or older. This is the easiest test to satisfy.
    
    - `:pseudo-static`
    
        This is usually the same as `:oldest`, unless the oldest gen to `gc`
        has been decreased.
    
    - `:static`
    
        To find a root of an image-backed object, you want to stop only at
        a truly `:static` object.
    
    `ignore` is a list of objects to treat as if nonexistent in the heap.
    It can often be useful for finding a path to an interned symbol other than
    through its package by specifying the package as an ignored object.
    
    `print` controls whether discovered paths should be returned or
    printed. Possible values are
    
    - `:verbose`
    
        Return no values. Print discovered paths using a verbose format
        with each node of each path on a separate line.
    
    - true (other than `:verbose`)
    
        Return no values. Print discovered paths using a compact format
        with all nodes of each path on a single line.
    
    - `nil`
    
        Do not print any output. Instead return the discovered paths as a
        list of lists. Each list has the form
    
            (TARGET . (ROOT NODE*))
    
        where `target` is one of the target of one of the `weak-pointers`.
    
        `root` is a description of the root at which the path starts and has
        one of the following forms:
    
        - `:static`
    
            If the root of the path is a non-collectible heap object.
    
        - `:pinned`
    
            If an unknown thread stack pins the root of the path.
    
        - `((thread-name | thread-object) symbol currentp)`
    
            If the path begins at a special binding of [`symbol`][e5af] in a thread.
            `currentp` is a [`boolean`][bfc5] indicating whether the value is current
            or shadowed by another binding.
    
        - `((thread-name | thread-object) guessed-pc)`
    
            If the path begins at a lexical variable in the function whose
            code contains `guessed-pc`.
    
        Each `node` in the remainder of the path is a cons (`object` . [`slot`][6f5c])
        indicating that the slot at index `slot` in `object` references the
        next path node.
    
    Experimental: subject to change without prior notice.

An example of using this could look like this:

    * (defvar *my-string* (list 1 2 "my string"))
    *MY-STRING*
    
     * (sb-ext:search-roots (sb-ext:make-weak-pointer (third *my-string*)))
     -> ((SIMPLE-VECTOR 3)) #x10004E9EAF[2] -> (SYMBOL) #x5044100F[1] -> (CONS) #x100181FAE7[1] -> (CONS) #x100181FAF7[1] -> (CONS) #x100181FB07[0] -> #x100181F9AF

The single line of output on [`*standard-output*`][e7ee] shows the path from a
root to `"my string"`: the path starts with SBCL's internal
package system data structures followed by the symbol
(`cl-user:*my-string*`) followed the three cons cells of the list.

The `:print :verbose` argument produces similar behavior but
describes the path elements in more detail:

    * (sb-ext:search-roots (sb-ext:make-weak-pointer (third *my-string*))
                           :print :verbose)
    Path to "my string":
     6       10004E9EAF [   2] a (simple-vector 3)
     0         5044100F [   1] COMMON-LISP-USER::*MY-STRING*
     0       100181FAE7 [   1] a cons
     0       100181FAF7 [   1] a cons
     0       100181FB07 [   0] a cons

The `:print nil` argument is a bit different:

    * (sb-ext:search-roots (sb-ext:make-weak-pointer (third *my-string*))
                           :print nil)
    (("my string" :STATIC (#(*MY-STRING* 0 0) . 2) (*MY-STRING* . 1)
      ((1 2 "my string") . 1) ((2 "my string") . 1) (("my string") . 0)))

There is no output on `*standard-output*`, and the return value is a
single path for the target object `"my string"`. As before, the
path shows the symbol and the three cons cells.

### 7.5 Generic Function Dispatch

If a generic function with standard or short method combination is
called, and the set of applicable methods does not include any
primary methods, then the generic function `sb-pcl:no-primary-method`
will be invoked with the arguments being the invoked generic
function and its arguments, similar to the standard function
[`no-applicable-method`][0525]. As with `no-applicable-method`, the default
method on `sb-pcl:no-primary-method` signals an error; programmers may
define methods on it.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40EXTENDED-SLOT-ACCESS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 7.6 Extended Slot Access

The slot access functions [`slot-value`][5a85], `(setf slot-value)`,
[`slot-boundp`][4a9d] and [`slot-makunbound`][e964] are defined to function as expected
on conditions (of metaclass `sb-pcl::condition-class`) and, with some
limitations, on structures (of metaclass [`structure-class`][e608]).

For structures:

- The name of a slot for the purposes of the slot access functions
  is the symbol used as the slot-name in the slot-description in the
  [`defstruct`][eac1] form;

- `slot-value` and [`slot-boundp`][4a9d] function as expected, including (for
  `slot-value`) calling and respecting the return value of
  [`slot-unbound`][c31a] if the slot is unbound; 

- `(setf slot-value)` functions as expected, including performing
  type checks to verify that the new value is of an appropriate type
  for the slot;

- `slot-makunbound` makes the slot unbound only when the slot
  corresponds to an `&aux` argument with no default in a
  by-order-of-arguments (BOA) constructor. In all other cases
  calling `slot-makunbound` on a structure signals an error.

- If any of the slot access functions is called with a structure
  instance which does not have a slot of the given name,
  [`slot-missing`][00a0] is called and the return value of the effective
  method, if any, is respected.

### 7.7 Metaobject Protocol

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40AMOP-COMPATIBILITY-OF-METAOBJECT-PROTOCOL-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 7.7.1 AMOP Compatibility of Metaobject Protocol

SBCL supports a metaobject protocol which is intended to be compatible
with AMOP; present exceptions to this (as distinct from current bugs)
are:

- `sb-mop:compute-effective-method` only returns one value, not two.
  There is no record of what the second return value was meant to
  indicate, and apparently no clients for it.

- The direct superclasses of `sb-mop:funcallable-standard-object` are
  ([`function`][a51f] [`standard-object`][a843]) instead of the correct (`standard-object`
  `function`).

    This is to ensure that the [`standard-object`][a843] class is the last of
    the standardized classes before class [`t`][9172] appearing in the
    precedence list of [`generic-function`][efe2] and
    [`standard-generic-function`][59ab], as required by `clhs` [`1.4.4.5`][7ebc].

- The arguments `:declare` and `:declarations` are both accepted by
  [`ensure-generic-function`][28e7], with the leftmost argument defining the
  declarations to be stored and returned by
  `sb-mop:generic-function-declarations`.

    Where AMOP specifies `:declarations` as the keyword argument to
    `ensure-generic-function`, the Common Lisp standard specifies
       `:declare`. Portable code should use `:declare`.

- Although SBCL obeys the requirement in AMOP that
  `sb-mop:validate-superclass` should treat [`standard-class`][c77f] and
  `sb-mop:funcallable-standard-class` as compatible metaclasses, we
  impose an additional requirement at class finalization time: a
  class of metaclass `sb-mop:funcallable-standard-class` must have
  `function` in its superclasses, and a class of metaclass
  `standard-class` must not.

    After a class has been finalized, it is associated with a class
    prototype which is accessible by a standard MOP function
    `sb-mop:class-prototype`. The user can then ask whether this
    object is a `function` or not in several different ways: whether
    it is a function according to [`typep`][0895]; whether its [`class-of`][6a98] is
    [`subtypep`][daac] `function`, or whether `function` appears in the
    superclasses of the class. The additional consistency
    requirement comes from the desire to make all of these answers
    the same.

    The following class definitions are bad, and will lead to errors
    either immediately or if an instance is created:

        (defclass bad-object (funcallable-standard-object)
          ()
          (:metaclass standard-class))
        (defclass bad-funcallable-object (standard-object)
          ()
          (:metaclass funcallable-standard-class))

    The following definition is acceptable:

        (defclass mixin ()
          ((slot :initarg slot)))
        (defclass funcallable-object (funcallable-standard-object mixin)
          ()
          (:metaclass funcallable-standard-class))

    and leads to a class whose instances are funcallable and have one slot.

    Note that this requirement also applies to the class
    `sb-mop:funcallable-standard-object`, which has metaclass
    `sb-mop:funcallable-standard-class` rather than `standard-class` as
    AMOP specifies.

- The requirement that *no portable class may inherit, by virtue of
  being a direct or indirect subclass of a specified class, any slot
  for which the name is a symbol accessible in the
  `common-lisp-user` package or exported by any package defined in
  the ANSI Common Lisp standard*. is interpreted to mean that the
  standardized classes themselves should not have slots named by
  external symbols of public packages.

    The rationale behind the restriction is likely to be similar to
    the ANSI Common Lisp restriction on defining functions,
    variables and types named by symbols in the Common Lisp package:
    preventing two independent pieces of software from colliding
    with each other.

- Specializations of the `new-value` argument to ([`setf`][a138]
  `sb-mop:slot-value-using-class`) are not allowed: all user-defined
  methods must have a specializer of the class [`t`][9172].

    This prohibition is motivated by a separation of layers: the
    `sb-mop:slot-value-using-class` family of functions is intended
    for use in implementing different and new slot allocation
    strategies, rather than in performing application-level
    dispatching. Additionally, with this requirement, there is a
    one-to-one mapping between metaclass, class and
    slot-definition-class tuples and effective methods of (`setf`
    `sb-mop:slot-value-using-class`), which permits optimization
    of (`setf` `sb-mop:slot-value-using-class`)'s discriminating
    function in the same manner as for `sb-mop:slot-value-using-class`
    and `sb-mop:slot-boundp-using-class`.

    Note that application code may specialize on the `new-value`
    argument of slot accessors.

- The class named by the `name` argument to `sb-mop:ensure-class`, if any, is
  only redefined if it is the proper name of that class; otherwise,
  a new class is created.

    This is consistent with the description `sb-mop:ensure-class` in
    AMOP as the functional version of [`defclass`][ead6], which has this
    behaviour; however, it is not consistent with the weaker
    requirement in AMOP, which states that any class found by
    [`find-class`][51fe], no matter what its [`class-name`][03fa], is
    redefined.

- An error is not signaled in the case of the `:name` initialization
  argument for `sb-mop:slot-definition` objects being a constant, when
  the slot definition is of type `sb-pcl::structure-slot-definition`
  (i.e. it is associated with a class of type [`structure-class`][e608]).

    This allows code which uses constant names for structure slots
    to continue working as specified in ANSI, while enforcing the
    constraint for all other types of slot.

- The class [`t`][9172] is not an instance of the [`built-in-class`][1f10] metaclass.

    AMOP specifies, in the *Inheritance Structure of Metaobject
    Classes* section, that the class [`t`][9172] should be an instance of
    `built-in-class`. However, it also specifies that
    `sb-mop:validate-superclass` should return true (indicating that a
    direct superclass relationship is permissible) if the second
    argument is the class [`t`][9172]. Also, ANSI specifies that classes with
    metaclass `built-in-class` may not be subclassed using `defclass`,
    and also that the class [`t`][9172] is the universal superclass,
    inconsistent with it being a `built-in-class`.

- Uses of [`change-class`][7af6] and redefinitions of classes with
  `defclass` (or the functional interfaces `sb-mop:ensure-class` or
  `sb-mop:ensure-class-using-class`) must ensure that for each slot
  with allocation `:instance` or `:class`, the set of applicable methods
  on the `sb-mop:slot-value-using-class` family of generic functions
  is the same before and after the change.

    This is required for correct operation of the protocol to update
    instances for the new or redefined class, and can be seen as
    part of the contract of the `:instance` or `:class` allocations.

- Metaobject protocol users may wish to override
  `sb-mop:compute-discriminating-function` for their own generic
  function classes. Overriding implementations of
  `sb-mop:compute-discriminating-function` must, in order to
  participate in the [`no-applicable-method`][0525] and
  `sb-pcl:no-primary-method` protocols, perform appropriate checks on
  the return value of [`compute-applicable-methods`][e30b] before processing
  the effective method; the standard effective method contains
  error-invoking forms, but those forms have no access to the
  generic function invocation's arguments.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40METAOBJECT-PROTOCOL-EXTENSIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 7.7.2 Metaobject Protocol Extensions

In addition, SBCL supports extensions to the Metaobject protocol from
AMOP; at present, they are:

- Compile-time support for generating specializer metaobjects from
  specializer names in [`defmethod`][6832] forms is provided by the
  `sb-pcl:make-method-specializers-form` function, which returns a
  form which, when evaluated in the lexical environment of the
  `defmethod`, returns a list of specializer metaobjects. This
  operator suffers from similar restrictions to those affecting
  `sb-mop:make-method-lambda`, namely that the generic function must
  be defined when the `defmethod` form is expanded, so that the
  correct method of `sb-pcl:make-method-specializers-form` is invoked.
  The system-provided method on `sb-pcl:make-method-specializers-form`
  generates a call to [`find-class`][51fe] for each symbol specializer name,
  and a call to `sb-mop:intern-eql-specializer` for each
  `(EQL <x>)` specializer name.

- Run-time support for converting between specializer names and
  specializer metaobjects, mostly for the purposes of [`find-method`][6d46],
  is provided by `sb-pcl:parse-specializer-using-class` and
  `sb-pcl:unparse-specializer-using-class`, which dispatch on their
  first argument, the generic function associated with a method with
  the given specializer. The system-provided methods on those
  methods convert between classes and proper names and between lists
  of the form `(EQL <x>)` and interned eql specializer objects.

- Distinguishing unbound instance allocated slots  from
  bound ones when using `sb-mop:standard-instance-access` and
  `sb-mop:funcallable-standard-instance-access` is possible by
  comparison to the symbol-macro `sb-pcl:+slot-unbound+`.

### 7.8 Extensible Sequences

ANSI Common Lisp has a class [`sequence`][ae23] with subclasses [`list`][9271] and
[`vector`][64b3], on which the sequence functions like [`find`][4e46], [`subseq`][4a86], etc.
operate. As an extension to the ANSI specification, SBCL allows
additional subclasses of `sequence` to be defined.

> A motivation, rationale and additional examples for the design of
> this extension can be found in the paper *Rhodes,
> Christophe (2007): User-extensible sequences in Common Lisp*
> available for download at
> <http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas01cr/papers/ilc2007/sequences-20070301.pdf>.

Users of this extension just make instances of `sequence` subclasses
and transparently operate on them using sequence functions:

    (coerce (subseq (make-instance 'my-sequence) 5 10) 'list)

From this perspective, no distinction between builtin and user-defined
`sequence` subclasses should be necessary.

Providers of the extension, that is of user-defined `sequence`
subclasses, have to adhere to a *sequence protocol* which consists
of a set of generic functions in the `sequence` package.

A minimal `sequence` subclass has to specify [`standard-object`][a843] and
`sequence` as its superclasses and has to be the specializer of the
`sequence` parameter of methods on at least the following generic
functions:

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3ALENGTH-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:length** *sequence*

    Returns the length of `sequence` or signals a
    [`sequence:protocol-unimplemented`][460c] error if the sequence protocol is
    not implemented for the class of `sequence`.

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AELT-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:elt** *sequence index*

    Returns the element at position `index` of `sequence` or signals a
    [`sequence:protocol-unimplemented`][460c] error if the sequence protocol is
    not implemented for the class of `sequence`.

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AELT-20DREF-3ASETF-GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [setf-generic-function] **sb-sequence:elt** *new-value sequence index*

    Replaces the element at position `index` of `sequence` with `new-value`
    and returns `new-value` or signals a [`sequence:protocol-unimplemented`][460c]
    error if the sequence protocol is not implemented for the class of
    `sequence`.

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AADJUST-SEQUENCE-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:adjust-sequence** *sequence length &key initial-element initial-contents*

    Returns destructively modified `sequence` or a freshly allocated
    sequence of the same class as `sequence` of length `length`. Elements
    of the returned sequence are initialized to `initial-element`, if
    supplied, initialized to `initial-contents` if supplied, or identical
    to the elements of `sequence` if neither is supplied. Signals a
    [`sequence:protocol-unimplemented`][460c] error if the sequence protocol is
    not implemented for the class of `sequence`.

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AMAKE-SEQUENCE-LIKE-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:make-sequence-like** *sequence length &key initial-element initial-contents*

    Returns a freshly allocated sequence of length `length` and of the
    same class as `sequence`. Elements of the new sequence are
    initialized to `initial-element`, if supplied, initialized to
    `initial-contents` if supplied, or undefined if neither is supplied.
    Signals a [`sequence:protocol-unimplemented`][460c] error if the sequence
    protocol is not implemented for the class of `sequence`.

`make-sequence-like` is needed for functions returning
freshly-allocated sequences such as [`subseq`][4a86] or [`copy-seq`][de40].
`adjust-sequence` is needed for functions which destructively modify
their arguments such as [`delete`][986c]. In fact, all other sequence
functions can be implemented in terms of the above functions and
actually are, if no additional methods are defined. However, relying
on these generic implementations, in particular not implementing the
[Iterator Protocol][5c43] can incur a high performance penalty.

When the sequence protocol is only partially implemented for a given
[`sequence`][ae23] subclass, an attempt to apply one of the missing operations
to instances of that class signals the following condition:

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3APROTOCOL-UNIMPLEMENTED-20CONDITION-29"></a>

- [condition] **sb-sequence:protocol-unimplemented** *[type-error][abfd] sb-int:reference-condition*

    This error is signaled if a sequence operation is applied to an
    instance of a sequence class that does not support the
    operation.

In addition to the mandatory functions above, methods on the sequence
functions listed below can be defined.

There are some noteworthy irregularities:

- The function [`sb-sequence:emptyp`][99a3] does not have a counterpart in the
  `cl` package. It is intended to be used instead of
  [`sb-sequence:length`][fca4] when working with lazy or infinite sequences.

- [`sb-sequence:dosequence`][1159] does not have a direct counterpart either.
  It is like [`dolist`][1bfd] in spirit but traverses generic sequences.

- The functions [`map`][7206], [`concatenate`][2ecb] and [`merge`][045f] receive a type designator
  specifying the type of the constructed sequence as their first
  argument. However, the corresponding generic functions
  [`sb-sequence:map`][0fc0], [`sb-sequence:concatenate`][38bd] and [`sb-sequence:merge`][f575]
  receive a prototype instance of the requested [`sequence`][ae23] subclass
  instead.

- [`cl:map-into`][a78a] has no generic sequence counterpart, as its lambda
  list does not provide reasonable specialization opportunities, but
  it supports extensible sequences directly.


<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AEMPTYP-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:emptyp** *sequence*

    Returns `t` if `sequence` is an empty sequence and `nil`
    otherwise. Signals an error if `sequence` is not a sequence.

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3ADOSEQUENCE-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-sequence:dosequence** *(element sequence &optional return) &body body*

    Executes `body` with `element` subsequently bound to each element of
    `sequence`, then returns `return`.

The remaining list parallels the *Sequence Dictionary*, see
[17.3][b2f8] in the ANSI spec.

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3ACOPY-SEQ-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:copy-seq** *sequence*

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AFILL-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:fill** *sequence item &key start end*

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3ASUBSEQ-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:subseq** *sequence start &optional end*

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AMAP-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:map** *result-prototype function sequence &rest sequences*

    Implements [`cl:map`][7206] for extended sequences.
    
    `result-prototype` corresponds to the `result-type` of `cl:map` but
    receives a prototype instance of an extended sequence class
    instead of a type specifier. By dispatching on `result-prototype`,
    methods on this generic function specify how extended sequence
    classes act when they are specified as the result type in a `cl:map`
    call. `result-prototype` may not be fully initialized and thus
    should only be used for dispatch and to determine its class.
    
    Another difference to `cl:map` is that `function` is a function, not a
    function designator.

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AREDUCE-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:reduce** *function sequence &key from-end start end initial-value key*

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3ASEARCH-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:search** *sequence1 sequence2 &key from-end start1 end1 start2 end2 test test-not key*

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AMISMATCH-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:replace** *sequence1 sequence2 &key start1 end1 start2 end2*

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3ACONCATENATE-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:concatenate** *result-prototype &rest sequences*

    Implements [`cl:concatenate`][2ecb] for extended sequences.
    
    `result-prototype` corresponds to the `result-type` of `cl:concatenate`
    but receives a prototype instance of an extended sequence class
    instead of a type specifier. By dispatching on `result-prototype`,
    methods on this generic function specify how extended sequence
    classes act when they are specified as the result type in a
    `cl:concatenate` call. `result-prototype` may not be fully initialized
    and thus should only be used for dispatch and to determine its
    class.

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AMERGE-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:merge** *result-prototype sequence1 sequence2 predicate &key key*

    Implements [`cl:merge`][045f] for extended sequences.
    
    `result-prototype` corresponds to the `result-type` of `cl:merge` but
    receives a prototype instance of an extended sequence class
    instead of a type specifier. By dispatching on `result-prototype`,
    methods on this generic function specify how extended sequence
    classes act when they are specified as the result type in a
    `cl:merge` call. `result-prototype` may not be fully initialized and
    thus should only be used for dispatch and to determine its class.
    
    Another difference to `cl:merge` is that `predicate` is a function,
    not a function designator.

Counting:

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3ACOUNT-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:count** *item sequence &key from-end start end test test-not key*

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:count-if** *pred sequence &key from-end start end key*

#### 7.8.1 Iterator Protocol

The general iterator protocol allows subsequently accessing some or
all elements of a sequence in forward or reverse direction. Users
first call [`sb-sequence:make-sequence-iterator`][3ae3] to create an iteration
state and receive functions to query and mutate it. These functions
allow, among other things, moving to, retrieving or modifying
elements of the sequence. The iteration state consists of a state
object, a limit object, a from-end indicator and six functions to
query or mutate this state.

An iterator is created by calling:

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AMAKE-SEQUENCE-ITERATOR-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:make-sequence-iterator** *sequence &key from-end start end*

    Returns a sequence iterator for `sequence` or, if `start` and/or `end`
    are supplied, the subsequence bounded by `start` and `end` as nine
    values:
    
    1. iterator state
    
    2. limit
    
    3. from-end
    
    4. step function
    
    5. endp function
    
    6. element function
    
    7. setf element function
    
    8. index function
    
    9. copy state function
    
    If `from-end` is `nil`, the constructed iterator visits the specified
    elements in the order in which they appear in `sequence`. Otherwise,
    the elements are visited in the opposite order.
    
    The six functions (items 4-9 in the list) have the same contract as
    the generic functions described in
    [Simple Iterator Protocol][e761]. In fact, when there is
    no specialized method for a particular `sequence` subclass,
    `sb-sequence:make-sequence-iterator` calls
    [`sb-sequence:make-simple-sequence-iterator`][20a0] and returns those six
    generic functions.

The following convenience macros simplify traversing sequences using
iterators:

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AWITH-SEQUENCE-ITERATOR-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-sequence:with-sequence-iterator** *(&optional iterator limit from-end-p step endp element set-element index copy) (sequence &key from-end (start 0) end) &body body*

    Executes `body` with the elements of `vars` bound to the iteration
    state returned by [`sequence:make-sequence-iterator`][3ae3] for `sequence` and
    `args`. Elements of `vars` may be `nil` in which case the corresponding
    value returned by `sequence:make-sequence-iterator` is ignored.

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AWITH-SEQUENCE-ITERATOR-FUNCTIONS-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-sequence:with-sequence-iterator-functions** *(&optional step endp elt setf index copy) (sequence &rest args &key from-end start end) &body body*

    Executes `body` with the names `step`, `endp`, `elt`, `setf`, `index` and `copy`
    bound to local functions which execute the iteration state query and
    mutation functions returned by [`sequence:make-sequence-iterator`][3ae3] for
    `sequence` and `args`. When some names are not supplied or `nil` is supplied
    for a given name, no local functions are established for those names.
    The functions established for `step`, `endp`, `elt`, `setf`, `index` and `copy`
    have dynamic extent.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40EXSEQ-SIMPLE-ITERATOR-PROTOCOL-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 7.8.2 Simple Iterator Protocol

For cases in which the full flexibility and performance of the general
sequence iterator protocol is not required, there is a simplified
sequence iterator protocol consisting of a few generic functions which
can be specialized for iterator classes:

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AITERATOR-STEP-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:iterator-step** *sequence iterator from-end*

    Moves `iterator` one position forward or backward in `sequence`
    depending on the iteration direction encoded in `from-end`.

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AITERATOR-ENDP-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:iterator-endp** *sequence iterator limit from-end*

    Returns non-`nil` when `iterator` has reached `limit` (which may
    correspond to the end of `sequence`) with respect to the iteration
    direction encoded in `from-end`.

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AITERATOR-ELEMENT-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:iterator-element** *sequence iterator*

    Returns the element of `sequence` associated to the position of
    `iterator`.

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AITERATOR-ELEMENT-20DREF-3ASETF-GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [setf-generic-function] **sb-sequence:iterator-element** *new-value sequence iterator*

    Destructively modifies `sequence` by replacing the sequence element
    associated to position of `iterator` with `new-value`.

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AITERATOR-INDEX-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:iterator-index** *sequence iterator*

    Returns the position of `iterator` in `sequence`.

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AITERATOR-COPY-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:iterator-copy** *sequence iterator*

    Returns a copy of `iterator` which also traverses `sequence` but can
    be mutated independently of `iterator`.

Iterator objects implementing the above simple iteration protocol are
created by calling the following generic function:

<a id="x-28SB-SEQUENCE-3AMAKE-SIMPLE-SEQUENCE-ITERATOR-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-sequence:make-simple-sequence-iterator** *sequence &key from-end start end*

    Returns a sequence iterator for `sequence`, `start`, `end` and `from-end`
    as three values:
    
    1. iterator state
    
    2. limit
    
    3. from-end
    
    The returned iterator can be used with the generic iterator
    functions described in [Simple Iterator Protocol][e761].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SUPPORT-FOR-UNIX-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 7.9 Support For Unix

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2APOSIX-ARGV-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*posix-argv\*** *"\<varies>"*

    A list of strings related to the UNIX command line (`argv` in C).
    
    [Runtime Options][3e4d] are processed and removed by the runtime.
    The default toplevel (see [`sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die`][9e55]) also removes the
    [Toplevel Options][6be4] that it processes.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3APOSIX-GETENV-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:posix-getenv** *name*

    Return the `value` part of the environment string `name=value` which
    corresponds to `name`, or `nil` if there is none. See `getenv(3)`.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3APOSIX-ENVIRON-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:posix-environ**

    Return the Unix environment as a list of [`simple-string`][ea6c]s. See `man environ`.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40RUNNING-EXTERNAL-PROGRAMS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 7.9.1 Running external programs

External programs can be run with [`sb-ext:run-program`][e0d4].

> *Note*: In SBCL versions prior to 1.0.13, `sb-ext:run-program`
> searched for executables in a manner somewhat incompatible with
> other languages. As of this version, SBCL uses the system library
> routine `execvp(3)`, and no longer contains the function
> `find-executable-in-search-path`, which implemented the old

> `run-program.lisp` versions 1.67 and earlier in SBCL's CVS
> repository here
> <http://sbcl.cvs.sourceforge.net/sbcl/sbcl/src/code/run-program.lisp?view=log>.
> However, we caution such users that this search routine finds
> executables that system library routines do not.


<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ARUN-PROGRAM-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:run-program** *program args &key env (environment (when env-p (unix-environment-sbcl-from-cmucl env))) (wait t) search pty input if-input-does-not-exist output (if-output-exists :error) (error :output) (if-error-exists :error) status-hook (external-format :default) directory preserve-fds use-posix-spawn*

    `run-program` creates a new process specified by `program`.
    `args` is a list of strings to be passed literally to the new program.
    In POSIX environments, this list becomes the array supplied as the second
    parameter to the execv() or execvp() system call, each list element becoming
    one array element. The strings should not contain shell escaping, as there is
    no shell involvement. Further note that while conventionally the process
    receives its own pathname in argv\[0\], that is automatic, and the 0th string
    should not be present in `args`.
    
    The program arguments and the environment are encoded using the
    default external format for streams.
    
    `run-program` will return a `process` structure. See the CMU Common Lisp
    Users Manual for details about the `process` structure.
    
    Notes about Unix environments (as in the `:environment` and `:env` args):
    
    - The SBCL implementation of `run-program`, like Perl and many other
      programs, but unlike the original CMU CL implementation, copies the
      Unix environment by default.
    
    - Running Unix programs from a setuid process, or in any other
      situation where the Unix environment is under the control of someone
      else, is a mother lode of security problems. If you are
      contemplating doing this, read about it first. (The Perl community
      has a lot of good documentation about this and other security issues
      in script-like programs.)
    
    The [`&key`][4336] arguments have the following meanings:
    
    - `:environment`
    
        A list of [`string`][68cc]s describing the new Unix environment
        (as in "man environ"). The default is to copy the environment of
        the current process.
    
    - `:env`
    
        An alternative lossy representation of the new Unix environment,
        for compatibility with CMU CL.
    
    - `:search`
    
        Look for `program` in each of the directories in the child's ​\$PATH
        environment variable. Otherwise an absolute pathname is required.
    
    - `:wait`
    
        If non-`nil` (default), wait until the created process finishes. If
        `nil`, continue running Lisp until the program finishes.
    
    - `:pty` (not supported on win32)
    
        Either `t`, `nil`, or a stream. Unless `nil`, the subprocess is
        established under a `pty`. If `:pty` is a stream, all output to this
        pty is sent to this stream, otherwise the `process-pty` slot is
        filled in with a stream connected to pty that can read output and
        write input.
    
    - `:input`
    
        Either `t`, `nil` (the default), a pathname, a stream, or `:stream`.
    
        - `t`: the standard input for the current process is inherited.
    
        - `nil`: `/dev/null` (nul on win32) is used.
    
        - Pathname: the specified file is used.
    
        - Stream: all the input is read from that stream and sent to the
          subprocess.
    
        - `:stream`: the [`process-input`][f442] slot is filled in with a stream that
          sends its output to the process.
    
    - `:if-input-does-not-exist` (when `:input` is the name of a file)
    
        It is one of:
    
        - `:error` to generate an error
    
        - `:create` to create an empty file
    
        - `nil` (the default) to return `nil` from `run-program`
    
    - `:output`
    
        Either `t`, `nil` (the default), a pathname, a stream, or `:stream`.
    
        - `t`: the standard output for the current process is inherited.
    
        - `nil`: `/dev/null` (nul on win32) is used.
    
        - Pathname: the specified file is used.
    
        - Stream: all the output from the process is written to this stream.
    
        - `:stream`: the [`process-output`][30e2] slot is filled in with a stream that
          can be read to get the output.
    
    - `:error`
    
        Same as `:output`, additionally accepts `:output`, making all error
        output routed to the same place as normal output. Defaults to
        `:output`.
    
    - `:if-output-exists` (when `:output` is the name of a file)
    
        It is one of:
    
        - `:error` (the default) to generate an error
    
        - `:supersede` to supersede the file with output from the program
    
        - `:append` to append output from the program to the file
    
        - `nil` to return `nil` from `run-program`, without doing anything
    
    - `:if-error-exists`
    
        Same as `:if-output-exists`, controlling `:error` output to files.
        Ignored when `:error` `:output`. Defaults to `:error`.
    
    - `:status-hook`
    
        This is a function the system calls whenever the status of the
        process changes. The function takes the process as an argument.
    
    - `:external-format`
    
        The external-format to use for `:input`, `:output`, and `:error` `:stream`s.
    
    - `:directory`
    
        Specifies the directory in which the program should be run.
        `nil` (the default) means the directory is unchanged.
    
    - `:preserve-fds`
    
        A sequence of file descriptors which should remain open in the child
        process.
    
    Windows specific options:
    
    - `:escape-arguments` (default `t`)
    
        Controls escaping of the arguments passed to CreateProcess.
    
    - `:window` (default `nil`)
    
        When `nil`, the subprocess decides how it will display its window.
        The following options control how the subprocess window should be
        displayed: `:hide`, `:show-normal`, `:show-maximized`,
        `:show-minimized`, `:show-no-activate`, `:show-min-no-active`,
        `:show-na`.
    
        > *Note*: console application subprocesses may or may not display
        > a console window depending on whether the SBCL runtime is itself
        > a console or GUI application. Invoke `cmd /c start` to
        > consistently display a console window or use the `:window`
        > `:hide` option to consistently hide the console window.

When [`sb-ext:run-program`][e0d4] is called with `:wait` `nil`, an process object
is returned. The following functions are available for use with
processes:

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3APROCESS-P-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:process-p** *object*

    `t` if `object` is a `process`, `nil` otherwise.

    Close all streams connected to `process`, stop maintaining the
    status slot. After `process-close`, [`process-alive-p`][c97f] and
    [`process-exit-code`][980e] can return stale information about a process, so
    should not be used.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3APROCESS-KILL-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:process-kill** *process signal &optional (whom :pid)*

    Hand `signal` to `process`. If `whom` is `:pid`, use the kill Unix system call. If
    `whom` is `:process-group`, use the `killpg(1)` Unix system call.
    Returns `t` if successful, otherwise returns `nil` and error
    number (two values).

### 7.10 Unicode Support

SBCL provides support for working with Unicode text and querying the
standard Unicode database for information about individual codepoints.
Unicode-related functions are located in the `sb-unicode` package.

SBCL also extends ANSI character literal syntax to support Unicode
codepoints. You can either specify a character by its Unicode name,
with spaces replaced by underscores if a unique name exists or by
giving its hexadecimal codepoint preceded by a `u`, an optional
`+`, and an arbitrary number of leading zeros. You may also input
the character directly into your source code if it can be encoded in
your file. If a character had an assigned name in Unicode 1.0 that
was distinct from its current name, you may also use that name (with
spaces replaced by underscores) to specify the character, unless the
name is already associated with a codepoint in the latest Unicode
standard (such as `bell`).

> *Note*: Please note that the codepoint `u+1f5cf` (Page) introduced
> in Unicode 7.0 is named `unicode_page`, since the name *Page* is
> required to be assigned to form-feed (`u+0c`) by the ANSI
> standard.

For example, you can specify the codepoint `u+00e1` ( *Latin Small
Letter A With Acute*) as

- `#\latin_small_letter_a_with_acute`

- `#\latin_small_letter_a_acute`

- `#\á` (assuming a Unicode source file)

- `#\u00e1`

- `#\ue1`

- `#\u+00e1`


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40UNICODE-PROPERTY-ACCESS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 7.10.1 Unicode property access

The following functions can be used to find information about a
Unicode codepoint.

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3AGENERAL-CATEGORY-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:general-category** *character*

    Returns the general category of `character` as it appears in UnicodeData.txt

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ABIDI-CLASS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:bidi-class** *character*

    Returns the bidirectional class of `character`

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ACOMBINING-CLASS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:combining-class** *character*

    Returns the canonical combining class (CCC) of `character`

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ADECIMAL-VALUE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:decimal-value** *character*

    Returns the decimal digit value associated with `character` or `nil` if
    there is no such value.
    
    The only characters in Unicode with a decimal digit value are those
    that are part of a range of characters that encode the digits 0-9.
    Because of this, `(decimal-digit c) <=> (digit-char-p c 10)` in
    `#+sb-unicode` builds

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ADIGIT-VALUE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

    Returns the Unicode digit value of `character` or `nil` if it doesn't exist.
    
    Digit values are guaranteed to be integers between 0 and 9 inclusive.
    All characters with decimal digit values have the same digit value,
    but there are characters (such as digits of number systems without a 0 value)
    that have a digit value but no decimal digit value

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ANUMERIC-VALUE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:numeric-value** *character*

    Returns the numeric value of `character` or `nil` if there is no such value.
    Numeric value is the most general of the Unicode numeric properties.
    The only constraint on the numeric value is that it be a rational number.

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3AMIRRORED-P-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:mirrored-p** *character*

- [function] **sb-unicode:age** *character*

    Returns the version of Unicode in which `character` was assigned as a pair
    of values, both integers, representing the major and minor version respectively.
    If `character` is not assigned in Unicode, returns `nil` for both values.

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3AHANGUL-SYLLABLE-TYPE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:hangul-syllable-type** *character*

    Returns the Hangul syllable type of `character`.
    The syllable type can be one of `:l`, `:v`, `:t`, `:lv`, or `:lvt`.
    If the character is not a Hangul syllable or Jamo, returns `nil`

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3AEAST-ASIAN-WIDTH-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:east-asian-width** *character*

    Returns the East Asian Width property of `character` as
    one of the keywords `:n` (Narrow), `:a` (Ambiguous), `:h` (Halfwidth),
    `:w` (Wide), `:f` (Fullwidth), or `:na` (Not applicable)

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ASCRIPT-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:script** *character*

    Returns the Script property of `character` as a keyword.
    If `character` does not have a known script, returns `:unknown`

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ACHAR-BLOCK-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:char-block** *character*

    Returns the Unicode block in which `character` resides as a keyword.
    If `character` does not have a known block, returns `:no-block`

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3AUNICODE-1-NAME-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:unicode-1-name** *character*

    Returns the name assigned to `character` in Unicode 1.0 if it is distinct
    from the name currently assigned to `character`. Otherwise, returns `nil`.
    This property has been officially obsoleted by the Unicode standard, and
    is only included for backwards compatibility.

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3APROPLIST-P-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:proplist-p** *character property*

    Returns `t` if `character` has the specified `property`.
    `property` is a keyword representing one of the properties from PropList.txt,
    with underscores replaced by dashes.

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3AUPPERCASE-P-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:uppercase-p** *character*

    Returns `t` if `character` has the Unicode property Uppercase and `nil` otherwise

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ALOWERCASE-P-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:lowercase-p** *character*

- [function] **sb-unicode:hex-digit-p** *character &key ascii*

    Returns `t` if `character` is a hexadecimal digit and `nil` otherwise.
    If `:ascii` is non-`nil`, fullwidth equivalents of the Latin letters A through F
    are excluded.

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ADEFAULT-IGNORABLE-P-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:default-ignorable-p** *character*

    Returns `t` if `character` is a Default\_Ignorable\_Code\_Point

    is `:east-asian`, Ambigious (class `:ai`) characters will be mapped to the
    Ideographic (`:id`) class instead of Alphabetic (`:al`).

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40STRING-OPERATIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 7.10.2 String operations

SBCL can normalize strings using:

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ANORMALIZE-STRING-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:normalize-string** *string &optional (form :nfd) filter*

    Normalize `string` to the Unicode normalization form `form`.
    Acceptable values for form are `:nfd`, `:nfc`, `:nfkd`, and `:nfkc`.
    If `filter` is a function it is called on each decomposed character and
    only characters for which it returns `t` are collected.

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ANORMALIZED-P-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:normalized-p** *string &optional (form :nfd)*

    Tests if `string` is normalized to `form`

SBCL implements the full range of Unicode case operations with the
functions

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3AUPPERCASE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:uppercase** *string &key locale*

    Returns the full uppercase of `string` according to the Unicode standard.
    The result is not guaranteed to have the same length as the input. If `:locale`
    is `nil`, no language-specific case transformations are applied. If `:locale` is a
    keyword representing a two-letter ISO country code, the case transforms of that
    locale are used. If `:locale` is `t`, the user's current locale is used (Unix and
    Win32 only).

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ALOWERCASE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:lowercase** *string &key locale*

    Returns the full lowercase of `string` according to the Unicode standard.
    The result is not guaranteed to have the same length as the input.
    `:locale` has the same semantics as the `:locale` argument to [`uppercase`][0eff].

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ATITLECASE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:titlecase** *string &key locale*

    Returns the titlecase of `string`. The resulting string can
    be longer than the input.
    `:locale` has the same semantics as the `:locale` argument to [`uppercase`][0eff].

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ACASEFOLD-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:casefold** *string*

    Returns the full casefolding of `string` according to the Unicode standard.
    Casefolding removes case information in a way that allows the results to be used
    for case-insensitive comparisons.
    The result is not guaranteed to have the same length as the input.

It also extends standard Common Lisp case functions such as
[`string-upcase`][5986] and [`string-downcase`][6c3c] to support a subset of Unicode's
casing behavior. Specifically, a character is [`both-case-p`][63b7] if its
case mapping in Unicode is one-to-one and invertable.

The `sb-unicode` package also provides functions for
collating/sorting strings according to the Unicode Collation
Algorithm.

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3AUNICODE-3C-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:unicode\<** *string1 string2 &key (start1 0) end1 (start2 0) end2*

    Determines whether `string1` sorts before `string2` using the Unicode Collation
    Algorithm. The function uses an untailored Default Unicode Collation Element Table
    to produce the sort keys. The function uses the Shifted method for dealing
    with variable-weight characters, as described in UTS #10

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3AUNICODE-3D-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:unicode=** *string1 string2 &key (start1 0) end1 (start2 0) end2 (strict t)*

    Determines whether `string1` and `string2` are canonically equivalent according
    to Unicode. The `start` and `end` arguments behave like the arguments to [`string=`][4143].
    If `:strict` is `nil`, `unicode=` tests compatibility equavalence instead.

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3AUNICODE-EQUAL-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:unicode-equal** *string1 string2 &key (start1 0) end1 (start2 0) end2 (strict t)*

    Determines whether `string1` and `string2` are canonically equivalent after
    casefolding (that is, ignoring case differences) according to Unicode. The
    `start` and `end` arguments behave like the arguments to [`string=`][4143]. If `:strict` is
    `nil`, [`unicode=`][03f5] tests compatibility equavalence instead.

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3AUNICODE-3C-3D-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:unicode\<=** *string1 string2 &key (start1 0) end1 (start2 0) end2*

    Tests if `string1` and `string2` are either [`unicode<`][53a6] or [`unicode=`][03f5]

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3AUNICODE-3E-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:unicode>** *string1 string2 &key (start1 0) end1 (start2 0) end2*

    Tests if `string2` is [`unicode<`][53a6] `string1`.

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3AUNICODE-3E-3D-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:unicode>=** *string1 string2 &key (start1 0) end1 (start2 0) end2*

    Tests if `string1` and `string2` are either [`unicode=`][03f5] or [`unicode>`][5149]

The following functions are provided for detecting visually
confusable strings:

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ACONFUSABLE-P-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:confusable-p** *string1 string2 &key (start1 0) end1 (start2 0) end2*

    Determines whether `string1` and `string2` could be visually confusable
    according to the IDNA confusableSummary.txt table

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40BREAKING-STRINGS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 7.10.3 Breaking strings

The `sb-unicode` package includes several functions for breaking a
Unicode string into useful parts.

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3AGRAPHEMES-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:graphemes** *string*

    Breaks `string` into graphemes according to the default
    grapheme breaking rules specified in UAX #29, returning a list of strings.

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3AWORDS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:words** *string*

    Breaks `string` into words according to the default
    word breaking rules specified in UAX #29. Returns a list of strings

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ASENTENCES-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:sentences** *string*

    Breaks `string` into sentences according to the default
    sentence breaking rules specified in UAX #29

<a id="x-28SB-UNICODE-3ALINES-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-unicode:lines** *string &key (margin \*print-right-margin\*)*

    Breaks `string` into lines that are no wider than `:margin` according to the
    line breaking rules outlined in UAX #14. Combining marks will always be kept
    together with their base characters, and spaces (but not other types of
    whitespace) will be removed from the end of lines. If `:margin` is unspecified,
    it defaults to 80 characters

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40CUSTOMIZATION-HOOKS-FOR-USERS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 7.11 Customization Hooks for Users

The toplevel repl prompt may be customized, and the function
that reads user input may be replaced completely. See the `:toplevel`
argument of [`sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die`][9e55].

The behaviour of [`require`][360d] when called with only one argument is
implementation-defined. In SBCL, `require` behaves in the following
way:

<a id="x-28REQUIRE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **require** *module-name &optional pathnames*

    Loads a module, unless it already has been loaded. `pathnames`, if supplied,
    is a designator for a list of pathnames to be loaded if the module
    needs to be. If `pathnames` is not supplied, functions from the list
    [`*module-provider-functions*`][bbfe] are called in order with `module-name`
    as an argument, until one of them returns non-`nil`.  User code is
    responsible for calling [`provide`][10c2] to indicate a successful load of the
    module.

    Also, see the [CLHS][d3da].

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2AMODULE-PROVIDER-FUNCTIONS-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*module-provider-functions\*** *(asdf/operate:module-provide-asdf sb-impl::module-provide-contrib)*

    See [`require`][360d].

Although SBCL does not provide a resident editor, the [`ed`][c0ba]
function can be customized to hook into user-provided editing
mechanisms as follows:

<a id="x-28ED-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **ed** *&optional x*

    Starts the editor (on a file or a function if named).  Functions
    from the list [`*ed-functions*`][3235] are called in order with `x` as an argument
    until one of them returns non-`nil`; these functions are responsible for
    signalling a [`file-error`][da60] to indicate failure to perform an operation on
    the file system.

    Also, see the [CLHS][9fe7].

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2AED-FUNCTIONS-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*ed-functions\*** *nil*

    See [`ed`][c0ba].

Conditions of type [`warning`][bcb6] and [`style-warning`][2056] are sometimes signaled at
runtime, especially during execution of Common Lisp defining forms
such as [`defun`][f472], [`defmethod`][6832], etc. To muffle these warnings at runtime,
SBCL provides a variable [`sb-ext:*muffled-warnings*`][ef88]:

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2AMUFFLED-WARNINGS-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*muffled-warnings\*** *sb-kernel:uninteresting-redefinition*

    A type that ought to specify a subtype of [`warning`][bcb6].  Whenever a
    warning is signaled, if the warning is of this type and is not
    handled by any other handler, it will be muffled.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40TOOLS-TO-HELP-DEVELOPERS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 7.12 Tools To Help Developers

SBCL provides a profiler and other extensions to the [`trace`][548d]
facility.

The debugger supports a number of options. Its documentation is
accessed by typing `help` at the debugger prompt. See [Debugger][825d].

Documentation for the command `inspect` is accessed by typing
`help` at the `inspect` prompt.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40RESOLUTION-OF-NAME-CONFLICTS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 7.13 Resolution of Name Conflicts

`clhs` [`11.1.1.2.5`][5d5b] requires that name conflicts in packages be
resolvable in favour of any of the conflicting symbols. In the
interactive debugger, this is achieved by prompting for the symbol
in whose favour the conflict should be resolved; for programmatic
use, the `sb-ext:resolve-conflict` restart should be invoked
with one argument, which should be a member of the list returned by
the condition accessor `sb-ext:name-conflict-symbols`.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40HASH-TABLE-EXTENSIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 7.14 Hash Table Extensions

hash table extensions supported by SBCL are all controlled by keyword
arguments to [`make-hash-table`][e826].

<a id="x-28MAKE-HASH-TABLE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **make-hash-table** *&key (test 'eql) (size 7) (rehash-size 1.5) (rehash-threshold 1) hash-function weakness synchronized*

    Create and return a new hash table. The keywords are as follows:
    
    - `:test`
    
        Determines how keys are compared. Must a designator for one of
        the standard hash table tests, or a hash table test defined
        using [`sb-ext:define-hash-table-test`][c29a]. Additionally, when an
        explicit `hash-function` is provided (see below), any two argument
        equivalence predicate can be used as the `test`.
    
    - `:size`
    
        A hint as to how many elements will be put in this hash table.
    
    - `:rehash-size`
    
        Indicates how to expand the table when it fills up. If an
        integer, add space for that many elements. If a floating point
        number (which must be greater than 1.0), multiply the size by
        that amount.
    
    - `:rehash-threshold`
    
        Indicates how dense the table can become before forcing a
        rehash. Can be any positive number \<=1, with density approaching
        zero as the threshold approaches 0. Density 1 means an average
        of one entry per bucket.
    
    - `:hash-function`
    
        If unsupplied, a hash function based on the `test` argument is
        used, which then must be one of the standardized hash table test
        functions, or one for which a default hash function has been
        defined using `sb-ext:define-hash-table-test`. If `hash-function` is
        specified, the `test` argument can be any two argument predicate
        consistent with it. The `hash-function` is expected to return a
        non-negative fixnum hash code. If `test` is neither standard nor
        defined by `define-hash-table-test`, then the `hash-function` must
        be specified.
    
    - `:weakness`
    
        When `:weakness` is not `nil`, garbage collection may remove entries
        from the hash table. The value of `:weakness` specifies how the
        presence of a key or value in the hash table preserves their
        entries from garbage collection.
    
        Valid values are:
    
        - `:key` means that the key of an entry must be live to guarantee
          that the entry is preserved.
    
        - `:value` means that the value of an entry must be live to
          guarantee that the entry is preserved.
    
        - `:key-and-value` means that both the key and the value must be
          live to guarantee that the entry is preserved.
    
        - `:key-or-value` means that either the key or the value must be
          live to guarantee that the entry is preserved.
    
        - `nil` (the default) means that entries are always preserved.
    
    - `:synchronized`
    
        If `nil` (the default), the hash-table may have multiple
        concurrent readers, but results are undefined if a thread writes
        to the hash-table concurrently with another reader or writer. If
        `t`, all concurrent accesses are safe, but note that CLHS
        3.6 (Traversal Rules and Side Effects) remains in force. See
        also: [`sb-ext:with-locked-hash-table`][3d3c].

    Also, see the [CLHS][452a].

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ADEFINE-HASH-TABLE-TEST-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-ext:define-hash-table-test** *name hash-function*

    Defines `name` as a new kind of hash table test for use with the `:test`
    argument to [`make-hash-table`][e826], and associates a default `hash-function` with it.
    
    `name` must be a symbol naming a global two argument equivalence predicate.
    Afterwards both '`name` and #'`name` can be used with `:test` argument. In both
    cases [`hash-table-test`][ebb7] will return the symbol `name`.
    
    `hash-function` must be a symbol naming a global hash function consistent with
    the predicate, or be a [`lambda`][650d] form implementing one in the current lexical
    environment. The hash function must compute the same hash code for any two
    objects for which `name` returns true, and subsequent calls with already hashed
    objects must always return the same hash code.
    
    > *Note*: The `:hash-function` keyword argument to `make-hash-table` can
    > be used to override the specified default hash-function.
    
    Attempting to define `name` in a locked package as hash-table test causes a
    package lock violation.
    
    Examples:
    
    ```
    ;; We want to use objects of type FOO as keys (by their
    ;; names.) EQUALP would work, but would make the names
    ;; case-insensitive -- which we don't want.
    (defstruct foo (name nil :type (or null string)))
    
    ;; Define an equivalence test function and a hash function.
    (defun foo-name= (f1 f2) (equal (foo-name f1) (foo-name f2)))
    (defun sxhash-foo-name (f) (sxhash (foo-name f)))
    
    (define-hash-table-test foo-name= sxhash-foo-name)
    
    ;; #'foo-name would work too.
    (defun make-foo-table () (make-hash-table :test 'foo-name=))
    ```
    
    ```
    (defun == (x y) (= x y))
    
    (define-hash-table-test ==
      (lambda (x)
        ;; Hash codes must be consistent with test, so
        ;; not (SXHASH X), since
        ;;   (= 1 1.0)                   => T
        ;;   (= (SXHASH 1) (SXHASH 1.0)) => NIL
        ;; Note: this doesn't deal with complex numbers or
        ;; bignums too large to represent as double floats.
        (sxhash (coerce x 'double-float))))
    
    ;; #'== would work too
    (defun make-number-table () (make-hash-table :test '==))
    ```

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AWITH-LOCKED-HASH-TABLE-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-ext:with-locked-hash-table** *(hash-table) &body body*

    Limits concurrent accesses to `hash-table` for the duration of `body`.
    If `hash-table` is synchronized, `body` will execute with exclusive
    ownership of the table. If `hash-table` is not synchronized, `body` will
    execute with other `with-locked-hash-table` bodies excluded -- exclusion
    of hash-table accesses not surrounded by `with-locked-hash-table` is
    unspecified.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AHASH-TABLE-SYNCHRONIZED-P-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:hash-table-synchronized-p** *ht*

    Returns `t` if [`hash-table`][7742] is synchronized.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AHASH-TABLE-WEAKNESS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:hash-table-weakness** *ht*

    Return the `weakness` of [`hash-table`][7742] which is one of `nil`, `:key`,
    `:value`, `:key-and-value`, `:key-or-value`.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40RANDOM-NUMBER-GENERATION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 7.15 Random Number Generation

The initial value of [`*random-state*`][acd7] is the same each time SBCL
is started. This makes it possible for user code to obtain
repeatable pseudo random numbers using only standard-provided
functionality. See [`sb-ext:seed-random-state`][e009] below for an SBCL
extension that allows to seed the random number generator from given
data for an additional possibility to achieve this. Non-repeatable
random numbers can always be obtained using ([`make-random-state`][db3f] `t`).

The sequence of numbers produced by repeated calls to [`random`][1f1d]
starting with the same random state and using the same sequence of
`limit` arguments is guaranteed to be reproducible only in the same
version of SBCL on the same platform, using the same code under the
same evaluator mode and compiler optimization qualities. Just two
examples of differences that may occur otherwise: calls to `random`
can be compiled differently depending on how much is known about the
`limit` argument at compile time, yielding different results even if
called with the same argument at run time, and the results can
differ depending on the machine's word size, for example for limits
that are fixnums under 64-bit word size but bignums under 32-bit
word size.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ASEED-RANDOM-STATE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:seed-random-state** *&optional state*

    Make a random state object. The optional `state` argument specifies a seed
    for deterministic pseudo-random number generation.
    
    As per the Common Lisp standard for [`make-random-state`][db3f],
    
    - If `state` is `nil` or not supplied, return a copy of the default
      [`*random-state*`][acd7].
    
    - If `state` is a random state, return a copy of it.
    
    - If `state` is `t`, return a randomly initialized state (using operating-system
      provided randomness where available, otherwise a poor substitute based on
      internal time and pid).
    
    As a supported SBCL extension, we also support receiving as a seed an object
    of the following types:
    
    - ([`simple-array`][451a] ([`unsigned-byte`][561a] 8) (\*))
    
    - `unsigned-byte`
    
    While we support arguments of any size and will mix the provided bits into
    the random state, it is probably overkill to provide more than 256 bits worth
    of actual information.
    
    This particular SBCL version also accepts an argument of the following type:
    (`simple-array` (`unsigned-byte` 32) (\*))
    
    This particular SBCL version uses the popular MT19937 PRNG algorithm, and its
    internal state only effectively contains about 19937 bits of information.
    <http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html>

Some notes on random floats: The standard doesn't prescribe a specific
method of generating random floats. The following paragraph
describes SBCL's current implementation and should be taken as
purely informational, that is, user code should not depend on any of
its specific properties. The method used has been chosen because it
is common, conceptually simple and fast.

To generate random floats, SBCL evaluates code that has an equivalent
effect as

    (* limit
       (float (/ (random (expt 2 23)) (expt 2 23)) 1.0f0))

(for [`single-float`][31a6]s) and correspondingly (with `52` and `1.0d0`
instead of `23` and `1.0f0`) for [`double-float`][0d57]s. Note especially that
this means that zero is a possible return value occurring with
probability `(expt 2 -23)` and `(expt 2 -52)`, respectively. Also
note that there exist twice as many equidistant floats between 0 and
1 as are generated. For example, the largest number that
`(random 1.0f0)` ever returns is `(float (/ (1- (expt 2 23)) (expt 2
23)) 1.0f0)` while `(float (/ (1- (expt 2 24)) (expt 2 24)) 1.0f0)`
is the largest `single-float` less than 1. This is a side effect of
the fact that the implementation uses the fastest possible
conversion from bits to floats.

SBCL currently uses the Mersenne Twister as its random number
generator, specifically the 32-bit version under both 32- and 64-bit
word size. The seeding algorithm has been improved several times by
the authors of the Mersenne Twister; SBCL uses the third version
(from 2002), which is still the most recent as of June 2012. The
implementation has been tested to provide output identical to the
recommended C implementation.

While the Mersenne Twister generates random numbers of much better
statistical quality than other widely used generators, it uses only
linear operations modulo 2 and thus fails some statistical
tests.

(See chapter 7 *Testing widely used RNGs* in *TestU01: A C Library
for Empirical Testing of Random Number Generators* by Pierre
L'Ecuyer and Richard Simard, ACM Transactions on Mathematical
Software, Vol. 33, article 22, 2007.)

For example, the distribution of ranks of (sufficiently large)
random binary matrices is much distorted compared to the
theoretically expected one when the matrices are generated by the
Mersenne Twister. Thus, applications that are sensitive to this
aspect should use a different type of generator.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40TIMEOUTS-AND-DEADLINES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 7.16 Timeouts and Deadlines

SBCL supports three different ways of restricting the execution time
available to individual operations or parts of computations:

- *Timeout Parameters*: Some operations such as thread
  synchronization primitives accept a `:timeout` parameter. See
  [Timeout Parameters][63f3].

- *Synchronous Timeouts (Deadlines)*: Certain operations that may
  suspend execution for extended periods of time such as [`cl:sleep`][8901],
  thread synchronization primitives, IO and waiting for external
  processes respect deadlines established for a part of a
  computation. See [Synchronous Timeouts][6494].

- *Asynchronous Timeouts*: Asynchronous timeouts can interrupt most
  computations at (almost) any point. Thus, this kind of timeouts is
  the most versatile but it is also somewhat unsafe. See
  [Asynchronous Timeouts][2050].


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40TIMEOUT-PARAMETERS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 7.16.1 Timeout Parameters

Certain operations accept `:timeout` keyword arguments. These only
affect the specific operation and must be specified at each call
site by passing a `:timeout` keyword argument and a corresponding
timeout value to the respective operation. Expiration of the timeout
before the operation completes results in either a normal return
with a return value indicating the timeout or in the signaling of a
specialized condition such as [`sb-thread:join-thread-error`][b715].

Example:

    (defun join-thread-within-5-seconds (thread)
      (multiple-value-bind (value result)
          (sb-thread:join-thread thread :default nil :timeout 5)
        (when (eq result :timeout)
          (error "Could not join ~A within 5 seconds" thread))
        value))

The above code attempts to join the specified thread for up to five
seconds, returning its value in case of success. If the thread is
still running after the five seconds have elapsed,
[`sb-thread:join-thread`][bcf9] indicates the timeout in its second return
value. If a `:default` value was not provided, `sb-thread:join-thread`
would signal a `sb-thread:join-thread-error` instead.

To wait for an arbitrary condition, optionally with a timeout, the
[`sb-ext:wait-for`][db00] macro can be used:

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AWAIT-FOR-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-ext:wait-for** *test-form &key timeout*

    Wait until `test-form` evaluates to true, then return its primary value.
    If [`timeout`][b488] is provided, waits at most approximately `timeout` seconds before
    returning `nil`.
    
    If [`with-deadline`][9a2a] has been used to provide a global deadline, signals a
    [`deadline-timeout`][41a3] if `test-form` doesn't evaluate to true before the
    deadline.
    
    Experimental: subject to change without prior notice.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SYNCHRONOUS-TIMEOUTS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 7.16.2 Synchronous Timeouts

Deadlines, in contrast to timeout parameters, are established for a
dynamic scope using the [`sb-sys:with-deadline`][9a2a] macro and indirectly
affect operations within that scope. In case of nested uses, the
effective deadline is the one that expires first unless an inner use
explicitly overrides outer deadlines.

<a id="x-28SB-SYS-3AWITH-DEADLINE-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-sys:with-deadline** *(&key seconds override) &body body*

    Arranges for a [`timeout`][b488] condition to be signalled if an operation
    respecting deadlines occurs either after the deadline has passed, or
    would take longer than the time left to complete.
    
    Currently only [`sleep`][8901], blocking IO operations, `sb-thread:get-mutex`, and
    [`sb-thread:condition-wait`][406a] respect deadlines, but this includes their
    implicit uses inside SBCL itself.
    
    Unless `override` is true, existing deadlines can only be restricted,
    not extended. Deadlines are per thread: children are unaffected by
    their parent's deadlines.
    
    Experimental.

Expiration of deadlines set up this way only has an effect when it
happens before or during the execution of a deadline-aware operation
([Operations Supporting Timeouts and Deadlines][f2ea]). In this case, a
[`sb-sys:deadline-timeout`][41a3] is signaled. A handler for this condition
type may use the [`sb-sys:defer-deadline`][32f2] or [`sb-sys:cancel-deadline`][8a60]
restarts to defer or cancel the deadline respectively and resume
execution of the interrupted operation.

<a id="x-28SB-SYS-3ADEADLINE-TIMEOUT-20CONDITION-29"></a>

- [condition] **sb-sys:deadline-timeout** *[sb-ext:timeout][b488]*

    Signaled when an operation in the context of a deadline takes
    longer than permitted by the deadline.

<a id="x-28SB-SYS-3ADEFER-DEADLINE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-sys:defer-deadline** *seconds &optional condition*

    Find the `defer-deadline` restart associated with `condition`, and
    invoke it with `seconds` as argument (deferring the deadline by that many
    seconds.) Otherwise return `nil` if the restart is not found.

<a id="x-28SB-SYS-3ACANCEL-DEADLINE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-sys:cancel-deadline** *&optional condition*

    Find and invoke the `cancel-deadline` restart associated with
    `condition`, or return `nil` if the restart is not found.

When a thread is executing the debugger, signaling of
[`sb-sys:deadline-timeout`][41a3] conditions for that thread is deferred until
it exits the debugger.

Example:

    (defun read-input ()
      (list (read-line) (read-line)))
    
    (defun do-it ()
      (sb-sys:with-deadline (:seconds 5))
        (read-input)
        (sleep 2)
        (sb-ext:run-program "my-program"))

The above code establishes a deadline of five seconds within which
the body of the `do-it` function should execute. All calls of
deadline-aware functions in the dynamic scope, in this case two
[`read-line`][8a51] calls, a [`sleep`][8901] call and a [`sb-ext:run-program`][e0d4] call, are
affected by the deadline. If, for example, the first `read-line` call
completes in one second and the second `read-line` call completes in
three seconds, a [`sb-sys:deadline-timeout`][41a3] condition will be signaled
after the `sleep` call has been executing for one second.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40ASYNCHRONOUS-TIMEOUTS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 7.16.3 Asynchronous Timeouts

Asynchronous timeouts are established for a dynamic scope using the
[`sb-ext:with-timeout`][5434] macro:

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AWITH-TIMEOUT-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-ext:with-timeout** *expires &body body*

    Execute the body, asynchronously interrupting it and signalling a [`timeout`][b488]
    condition after at least `expires` seconds have passed.
    
    Note that it is never safe to unwind from an asynchronous condition. Consider:
    
        (defun call-with-foo (function)
          (let (foo)
            (unwind-protect
               (progn
                 (setf foo (get-foo))
                 (funcall function foo))
             (when foo
               (release-foo foo)))))
    
    If `timeout` occurs after `get-foo` has executed, but before the
    assignment, then `release-foo` will be missed. While individual sites
    like this can be made proof against asynchronous unwinds, this doesn't
    solve the fundamental issue, as all the frames potentially unwound
    through need to be proofed, which includes both system and application
    code -- and in essence proofing everything will make the system
    uninterruptible.

Expiration of the timeout will cause the operation being executed at
that moment to be interrupted by an asynchronously signaled
[`sb-ext:timeout`][b488] condition, (almost) irregardless of the operation
and its context.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ATIMEOUT-20CONDITION-29"></a>

- [condition] **sb-ext:timeout** *[serious-condition][af00]*

    Signaled when an operation does not complete within an allotted time budget.

### 7.17 Miscellaneous Extensions

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AARRAY-STORAGE-VECTOR-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:array-storage-vector** *array*

    Returns the underlying storage vector of `array`, which must be a non-displaced array.
    
    In SBCL, if `array` is a of type ([`simple-array`][451a] \* (\*)), it is its own storage
    vector. Multidimensional arrays, arrays with fill pointers, and adjustable
    arrays have an underlying storage vector with the same [`array-element-type`][a917] as
    `array`, which this function returns.
    
    > *Note*: the underlying vector is an implementation detail. Even
    > though this function exposes it, changes in the implementation may
    > cause this function to be removed without further warning.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ADELETE-DIRECTORY-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:delete-directory** *pathspec &key recursive*

    Deletes the directory designated by `pathspec` (a pathname designator).
    Returns the truename of the directory deleted.
    
    If `recursive` is false (the default), signals an error unless the directory is
    empty. If `recursive` is true, first deletes all files and subdirectories. If
    `recursive` is true and the directory contains symbolic links, the links are
    deleted, not the files and directories they point to.
    
    Signals an error if `pathspec` designates a file or a symbolic link instead of a
    directory, or if the directory could not be deleted for any reason.
    
    Both
    
        (DELETE-DIRECTORY "/tmp/foo")
        (DELETE-DIRECTORY "/tmp/foo/")
    
    delete the `"foo"` subdirectory of `"/tmp"`, or signal an error if
    it does not exist or if is a file or a symbolic link.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AGET-TIME-OF-DAY-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:get-time-of-day**

    Return the number of seconds and microseconds since the beginning of
    the UNIX epoch (January 1st 1970.)

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AASSERT-VERSION--3E-3D-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:assert-version->=** *&rest subversions*

    Asserts that the current SBCL is of version equal to or greater than
    the version specified in the arguments.  A continuable error is signaled
    otherwise.
    
    The arguments specify a sequence of subversion numbers in big endian order.
    They are compared lexicographically with the runtime version, and versions
    are treated as though trailed by an unbounded number of 0s.
    
    For example, (`assert-version->=` 1 1 4) asserts that the current SBCL
    is version 1.1.4\[.0.0...\] or greater, and (`assert-version->=` 1) that
    it is version 1\[.0.0...\] or greater.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AUNENCAPSULATED-FUNCTION-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:unencapsulated-function** *function*

    Return the innermost function within any encapsulations of the
    function designated by `function`. The identity of the returned
    function is not affected by encapsulations.
    
    Note that the unencapsulated function may be [`eq`][5a82] to the designated
    function even in the presence of encapsulations. For generic
    functions, this is currently always the case.

<a id="x-28DOCUMENTATION-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **documentation** *object doc-type*

    Return the documentation string of `doc-type` for `object`,
    or `nil` if none exists. In addition to the `doc-type`s and methods
    required by ANSI, SBCL's `documentation` (and its [`setf`][a138]) supports methods
    with the following signatures:
    
    - `(object symbol) (doc-type (eql declaration))`
    
    - `(object sb-mop:slot-definition) (doc-type (eql t))`
    
    Since [`condition`][83e1]s are implemented as classes in SBCL, the following
    also work:
    
    - `(object condition) (doc-type (eql t))`
    
    - `(object condition) (doc-type (eql 'type))`
    
    Function documentation is stored separately for function names and objects:
    [`defun`][f472], [`lambda`][650d], \&co create function objects with the specified documentation
    strings.
    
        (setf (documentation name 'function) string)
    
    sets the documentation string stored under the specified name, and
    
        (setf (documentation func t) string)
    
    sets the documentation string stored in the function object.
    
        (documentation name 'function)
    
    returns the documentation stored under the function name if any, and
    falls back on the documentation in the function object if necessary.

    Also, see the [CLHS][c5ae].

### 7.18 Stale Extensions

SBCL has inherited from CMUCL various hooks to allow the user to
tweak and monitor the garbage collection process. These are somewhat
stale code, and their interface might need to be cleaned up. If you
have urgent need of them, look at the code in `src/code/gc.lisp` and
bring it up on the developers' mailing list.

SBCL has various hooks inherited from CMUCL, like
`sb-ext:float-denormalized-p`, to allow a program to take advantage of
IEEE floating point arithmetic properties which aren't conveniently
or efficiently expressible using the ANSI standard. These look good,
and their interface looks good, but IEEE support is slightly broken
due to a stupid decision to remove some support for infinities
(because it wasn't in the ANSI spec and it didn't occur to me that
it was in the IEEE spec). If you need this stuff, take a look at the
code and bring it up on the developers' mailing list.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40EFFICIENCY-HACKS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 7.19 Efficiency Hacks

The `sb-ext:purify` function (available when `#+cheneygc`) causes
SBCL first to collect all garbage, then to mark all uncollected
objects as permanent, never again attempting to collect them as
garbage. This can cause a large increase in efficiency when using a
primitive garbage collector, or a more moderate increase in
efficiency when using a more sophisticated garbage collector which
is well suited to the program's memory usage pattern. It also allows
permanent code to be frozen at fixed addresses, a precondition for
using copy-on-write to share code between multiple Lisp processes.
This is less important with modern generational GC, but not all
SBCL platforms use such a garbage collector.

The `sb-ext:truly-the` special form declares the type of the result of
the operations, producing its argument; the declaration is not
checked. In short: don't use it.

The `sb-ext:freeze-type` declaration declares that a type will never
change, which can make type testing (e.g. with [`typep`][0895]) more efficient
for structure types.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40EXTERNAL-FORMATS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

## 8 External Formats

External formats determine the coding of characters from/to sequences
of octets when exchanging data with the outside world. Examples of
such exchanges are:

- Character streams associated with files, sockets and process
  input/output (see [Stream External Formats][7055] and
  [Running external programs][52f0])

- Names of files

- Foreign strings (see [Foreign Types and Lisp Types][7edc])

- Posix interface (see [sb-posix][3ddd])

- Hostname- and protocol-related functions of the BSD-socket interface
  (see [Networking][a9ee])

Technically, external formats in SBCL are named objects describing
coding of characters as well as policies in case de- or encoding is
not possible. Each external format has a canonical name and zero or
more aliases. User code mostly interacts with external formats by
supplying external format designators to functions that use external
formats internally.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DEFAULT-EXTERNAL-FORMAT-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 8.1 The Default External Format

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2ADEFAULT-EXTERNAL-FORMAT-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*default-external-format\*** *:utf-8*

    Most functions interacting with external formats ([`open`][6547], notably)
    use this default.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2ADEFAULT-SOURCE-EXTERNAL-FORMAT-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*default-source-external-format\*** *:default*

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3A-2ADEFAULT-C-STRING-EXTERNAL-FORMAT-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-ext:\*default-c-string-external-format\*** *:utf-8*

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40EXTERNAL-FORMAT-DESIGNATORS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 8.2 External Format Designators

In situations where an external format designator is required, such as
the `:external-format` argument in calls to [`open`][6547] or [`with-open-file`][9ac2],
users may supply the name of an encoding to denote the external
format which is applying that encoding to Lisp characters.

In addition to the basic encoding for an external format, options
controlling various special cases may be passed, by using a list
(whose first element must be an encoding name and whose rest is a
plist) as an external file format designator.

More specifically, external format designators can take the
following forms:

- `:default`: Designates the current default external format (see
  [The Default External Format][bffa]).

- `<keyword>`: Designates the supported external format that has
  `<keyword>` as one of its names (see [Supported External Formats][11f9]).

- `(<keyword> . <options-plist>)`: Designates an external format
  that is like the one designated by `<keyword>` with options as
  specified in `<options-plist>`.

Valid options for `<options-plist>` are:

- `:NEWLINE <newline>`

    An external format with an explicit `:newline` option is like its
    `<keyword>` parent but recognizes certain characters or
    character sequences as newlines. For `:lf` (the default), the
    `#\Linefeed` character is treated as `#\Newline` for both
    input and output. For `:cr`, `#\Return` is treated as
    `#\Newline`, while for `:crlf` the two-character sequence
    `#\Return #\Linefeed` is translated to and from
    `#\Newline`.

- `:REPLACEMENT <replacement>`

    An external format with an explicit `:replacement` option is like
    its `<keyword>` parent but does not signal an error in case a
    character or octet sequence cannot be en- or decoded. Instead,
    it inserts `<replacement>` at the position in question.
    `<replacement>` must be a string designator; that is, a
    character or a string.

For example:

    (with-open-file (stream pathname :external-format '(:utf-8 :replacement #\?))
      (read-line stream))

will read the first line of `pathname`, replacing any octet
sequence that is not valid in the UTF-8 external format with a
question mark character.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40CHARACTER-CODING-CONDITIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 8.3 Character Coding Conditions

De- or encoding characters using a given external format is not always
possible:

- Decoding an octet vector using a given external format can fail if
  it contains an octet or sequence of octets that does not have an
  interpretation as a character according to the external format.

- Conversely, a string may contain characters that a given external
  format cannot encode. For example, the ASCII external format
  cannot encode the character `#\ö`.

Unless the external format governing the coding uses the
`:replacement` option, SBCL will signal (continuable) errors under the
above circumstances. The types of the condition signaled are not
currently exported or documented but will be in future SBCL
versions.

### 8.4 Converting between Strings and Octet Vectors

To encode Lisp strings as octet vectors and decode octet vectors as
Lisp strings, the following SBCL-specific functions can be used:

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ASTRING-TO-OCTETS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:string-to-octets** *string &key (external-format :default) (start 0) end null-terminate*

    Return an octet vector that is `string` encoded according to `external-format`.
    
    If `external-format` is given, it must designate an external format.
    
    If given, `start` and `end` must be bounding index designators and
    designate a subsequence of `string` that should be encoded.
    
    If `null-terminate` is true, the returned octet vector ends with an
    additional 0 element that does not correspond to any part of `string`.
    
    If some of the characters of `string` (or the subsequence bounded by
    `start` and `end`) cannot be encoded by `external-format` an error of a
    subtype of `sb-int:character-encoding-error` is signaled.
    
    Note that for some values of `external-format` and `null-terminate` the
    length of the returned vector may be different from the length of
    `string` (or the subsequence bounded by `start` and `end`).

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AOCTETS-TO-STRING-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:octets-to-string** *vector &key (external-format :default) (start 0) end*

    Return a string obtained by decoding `vector` according to `external-format`.
    
    If `external-format` is given, it must designate an external format.
    
    If given, `start` and `end` must be bounding index designators and
    designate a subsequence of `vector` that should be decoded.
    
    If some of the octets of `vector` (or the subsequence bounded by `start`
    and `end`) cannot be decoded by `external-format` an error of a subtype of
    `sb-int:character-decoding-error` is signaled.
    
    Note that for some values of `external-format` the length of the
    returned string may be different from the length of `vector` (or the
    subsequence bounded by `start` and `end`).

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SUPPORTED-EXTERNAL-FORMATS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

## 9 Foreign Function Interface

This chapter describes SBCL's interface to C programs and
libraries (and, since C interfaces are a sort of *lingua franca*
of the Unix world, to other programs and libraries in general).

> *Note*: In the modern Lisp world, the usual term for this
> functionality is Foreign Function Interface, or FFI, where despite
> the mention of *function* in this term, FFI also refers to direct
> manipulation of C data structures as well as functions. The
> traditional CMUCL terminology is Alien Interface, and while that

> documentation, it still reflected in names in the implementation,
> notably in the name of the `sb-alien` package.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-FOREIGN-FUNCTION-INTERFACE-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 9.1 Introduction to the Foreign Function Interface

Because of Lisp's emphasis on dynamic memory allocation and garbage
collection, Lisp implementations use non-C-like memory
representations for objects. This representation mismatch creates
friction when a Lisp program must share objects with programs which
expect C data. There are three common approaches to establishing
communication:

- The burden can be placed on the foreign program (and programmer)
  by requiring the knowledge and use of the representations used
  internally by the Lisp implementation. This can require a
  considerable amount of "glue" code on the C side, and that code
  tends to be sensitively dependent on the internal implementation
  details of the Lisp system.

- The Lisp system can automatically convert objects back and forth
  between the Lisp and foreign representations. This is convenient,
  but translation becomes prohibitively slow when large or complex
  data structures must be shared. This approach is supported by the
  SBCL FFI, and used automatically when passing integers and
  strings.

- The Lisp program can directly manipulate foreign objects through
  the use of extensions to the Lisp language.

SBCL, like CMUCL before it, relies primarily on the automatic
conversion and direct manipulation approaches. The `sb-alien`
package provides a facility wherein foreign values of simple scalar
types are automatically converted and complex types are directly
manipulated in their foreign representation. Additionally the
lower-level System Area Pointers (or SAPs) can be used where
necessary to provide untyped access to foreign memory.

Any foreign objects that can't automatically be converted into Lisp
values are represented by objects of type
`sb-alien-internals:alien-value` Since Lisp is a dynamically typed
language, even foreign objects must have a run-time type; this type
information is provided by encapsulating the raw pointer to the
foreign data within an `sb-alien-internals:alien-value` object.

The type language and operations on foreign types are intentionally
similar to those of the C language.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40FOREIGN-TYPES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 9.2 Foreign Types

Alien types have a description language based on nested list
structure. For example the C type

    struct foo {
        int a;
        struct foo *b[100];
    };

has the corresponding SBCL FFI type

    (struct foo
      (a int)
      (b (array (* (struct foo)) 100)))


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DEFINING-FOREIGN-TYPES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 9.2.1 Defining Foreign Types

Types may be either named or anonymous. With structure and union
types, the name is part of the type specifier, allowing recursively
defined types such as:

    (struct foo (a (* (struct foo))))

An anonymous structure or union type is specified by using the name
`nil`. The [`with-alien`][3ae4] macro defines a local scope which *captures* any
named type definitions. Other types are not inherently named, but
can be given named abbreviations using the `define-alien-type` macro.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40FOREIGN-TYPES-AND-LISP-TYPES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 9.2.2 Foreign Types and Lisp Types

The foreign types form a subsystem of the SBCL type system. An
`alien` type specifier provides a way to use any foreign type as a
Lisp type specifier. For example,

    (typep foo '(alien (* int)))

can be used to determine whether `foo` is a pointer to a foreign
`int`. `alien` type specifiers can be used in the same ways as
ordinary Lisp type specifiers (like [`string`][68cc].) Alien type declarations
are subject to the same precise type checking as any other
declaration. See [Precise Type Checking][ade9].

Note that the type identifiers used in the foreign type system
overlap with native Lisp type specifiers in some cases. For example,
the type specifier `(alien single-float)` is identical to
[`single-float`][31a6], since foreign floats are automatically converted to
Lisp floats. When [`type-of`][9caa] is called on an alien value that is not
automatically converted to a Lisp value, then it will return an
`alien` type specifier.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40FOREIGN-TYPE-SPECIFIERS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 9.2.3 Foreign Type Specifiers

> *Note*: All foreign type names are exported from the `sb-alien`
> package. Some foreign type names are also symbols in the
> `common-lisp` package, in which case they are reexported from the
> `sb-alien` package, so that e.g. it is legal to refer to
> [`single-float`][31a6].

These are the basic foreign type specifiers:

- The foreign type specifier `(* <foo>)` describes a pointer to an
  object of type `<foo>`. A pointed-to type `<foo>` of `t` indicates a
  pointer to anything, similar to `void *` in ANSI C. A null alien
  pointer can be detected with the `null-alien` function.

- The foreign type specifier `(array <foo> &rest <dimensions>)`
  describes array of the specified `<dimensions>`, holding elements
  of type `<foo>`. Note that (unlike in C) `(* <foo>)` and
  `(array <foo>)` are considered to be different types when
  type checking is done. If equivalence of pointer and array types
  is desired, it may be explicitly coerced using [`cast`][b385].

Arrays are accessed using [`deref`][85de], passing the indices
as additional arguments.  Elements are stored in row-major order
(as in C), so the first dimension determines only the size of the
memory block, and not the layout of the higher dimensions. An array
whose first dimension is variable may be specified by using `nil` as
the first dimension. Fixed-size arrays can be allocated as array
elements, structure slots or [`with-alien`][3ae4] variables. Dynamic arrays
can only be allocated using [`make-alien`][fb92].

- The foreign type specifier `(struct <name> &rest <fields>)`
  describes a structure type with the specified `<name>` and
  `<fields>`. Fields are allocated at the same offsets used by the
  implementation's C compiler, as guessed by the SBCL internals.
  An optional `:alignment` keyword argument can be specified for each
  field to explicitly control the alignment of a field. If `<name>`
  is `nil` then the structure is anonymous.

    If a named foreign `struct` specifier is passed to
    `define-alien-type` or `with-alien`, then this defines,
    respectively, a new global or local foreign structure type. If
    no `<fields>` are specified, then the fields are taken from the
    current (local or global) alien structure type definition of
    `<name>`.

- The foreign type specifier `(union <name> &rest <fields>)` is
  similar to `struct` but describes a union type. All fields are
  allocated at the same offset, and the size of the union is the
  size of the largest field. The programmer must determine which
  field is active from context.

- The foreign type specifier `(enum <name> &rest <specs>)` describes
  an enumeration type that maps between integer values and symbols.
  If `<name>` is `nil`, then the type is anonymous. Each element of
  the `<specs>` list is either a Lisp symbol, or a list
  `(<symbol> <value>)`. `<value>` is an integer. If `<value>` is not
  supplied, then it defaults to one greater than the value for the
  preceding spec (or to zero if it is the first spec).

- The foreign type specifier `(signed &optional <bits>)` specifies a
  signed integer with the specified number of `<bits>` precision.
  The upper limit on integer precision is determined by the
  machine's word size. If `<bits>` is not specified, the maximum
  size will be used.

- The foreign type specifier `(integer &optional <bits>)` is
  equivalent to the corresponding type specifier using `signed`
  instead of [`integer`][9b12].

- The foreign type specifier `(unsigned &optional <bits>)` is like
  corresponding type specifier using `signed` except that the variable
  is treated as an unsigned integer.

- The foreign type specifier `(boolean &optional <bits>)` is similar
  to an enumeration type but maps from Lisp `nil` and `t` to C 0 and 1
  respectively. `<bits>` determines the amount of storage allocated
  to hold the truth value.

- The foreign type specifier `single-float` describes a
  floating-point number in IEEE single-precision format.

- The foreign type specifier `double-float` describes a
  floating-point number in IEEE double-precision format.

- The foreign type specifier `(function <result-type> &rest
  <arg-types>)` describes a foreign function that takes arguments of
  the specified `<arg-types>` and returns a result of type
  `<result-type>`. Note that the only context where a foreign
  `function` type is directly specified is in the argument to
  [`alien-funcall`][c886]. In all other contexts, foreign functions are
  represented by foreign function pointer types: `(* (function
  ...))`.

- The foreign type specifier `system-area-pointer` describes a
  pointer which is represented in Lisp as a `system-area-pointer`
  object. SBCL exports this type from `sb-alien` because CMUCL did,
  but tentatively (as of the first draft of this section of the
  manual, SBCL 0.7.6) it is deprecated, since it doesn't seem to be
  required by user code.

- The foreign type specifier `void` is used in function types to
  declare that no useful value is returned. Using `alien-funcall` to
  call a `void` foreign function will return zero values.

- The foreign type specifier `(c-string &key <external-format>
  <element-type> <not-null>)` is similar to `(* char)` but is
  interpreted as a null-terminated string, and is automatically
  converted into a Lisp string when accessed; or if the pointer is C
  `null` or 0, then accessing it gives Lisp `nil` unless
  `<not-null>` is true, in which case a [`type-error`][abfd] is signalled.

    external format conversion is automatically done when Lisp
    strings are passed to foreign code, or when foreign strings are
    passed to Lisp code. If the type specifier has an explicit
    `<external-format>`, that external format will be used.
    Otherwise [`sb-ext:*default-c-string-external-format*`][08b9] will be
    used. For example, when the following alien routine is called,
    the Lisp string given as argument is converted to an EBCDIC
    octet representation.

        (define-alien-routine test int (str (c-string :external-format :ebcdic-us)))

    Lisp strings of type [`base-string`][86d8] are stored with a trailing
    `NUL` termination, so no copying (either by the user or the
    implementation) is necessary when passing them to foreign code,
    assuming that the `<external-format>` and `<element-type>` of
    the `c-string` type are compatible with the internal
    representation of the string. For an SBCL built with Unicode
    support that means an `<external-format>` of `:ascii` and an
    `<element-type>` of [`base-char`][92f9]. Without Unicode support the
    `<external-format>` can also be `:iso-8859-1`, and the
    `<element-type>` can also be [`character`][32e3]. If
    `<external-format>` and `<element-type>` are not compatible, or
    the string is a `(simple-array character (*))`, this data is
    copied by the implementation as required.

    Assigning a Lisp string to a `c-string` structure field or
    variable stores the contents of the string to the memory already
    pointed to by that variable. When a foreign object of type
    `(* char)` is assigned to a `c-string`, then the `c-string` pointer
    is assigned to. This allows `c-string` pointers to be initialized.
    For example:

        (cl:in-package "CL-USER") ; which USEs package "SB-ALIEN"
        
        (define-alien-type nil (struct foo (str c-string)))
        
        (defun make-foo (str)
          (let ((my-foo (make-alien (struct foo))))
            (setf (slot my-foo 'str) (make-alien char (length str))
                  (slot my-foo 'str) str)
            my-foo))

    Storing Lisp `nil` in a `c-string` writes C `NULL` to the
    variable.


- `sb-alien` also exports translations of these C type
specifiers as foreign type specifiers:

  [`char`][ee36], `short`, `int`, `long`, `unsigned-char`, `unsigned-short`,
  `unsigned-int`, `unsigned-long`, [`float`][eee2], `double`, `size-t`, `off-t`

### 9.3 Operations On Foreign Values

This section describes how to read foreign values as Lisp values,
how to coerce foreign values to different kinds of foreign values,
and how to dynamically allocate and free foreign variables.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40ACCESSING-FOREIGN-VALUES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 9.3.1 Accessing Foreign Values

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3ADEREF-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **deref** *alien &rest indices*

    Dereference an `alien` pointer or array. When dereferencing a pointer,
    an optional single index can be specified to give the equivalent of
    C pointer arithmetic; this index is scaled by the size of the type
    pointed to. When dereferencing an array, the number of indices must
    be the same as the number of dimensions in the array type. [`setf`][a138]able.

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3ASLOT-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **slot** *alien slot*

    Extract the value of the slot named `slot` from a foreign `struct` or
    [`union`][d6c7] `alien`. If `alien` is a pointer to a structure or union, then it
    is automatically dereferenced. [`setf`][a138]able.
    
    Note that `slot` is evaluated, and need not be a compile-time
    constant (but only constant slot accesses are efficiently compiled).

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40UNTYPED-MEMORY-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

##### Untyped memory

As noted at the beginning of the chapter, the System Area Pointer
facilities allow untyped access to foreign memory. SAPs can be
converted to and from the usual typed foreign values using [`sap-alien`][3208]
and [`alien-sap`][213e], and also to and from integers (raw machine
addresses). They should thus be used with caution; corrupting the
Lisp heap or other memory with SAPs is trivial.

<a id="x-28SB-SYS-3AINT-SAP-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-sys:int-sap** *x*

    Creates a `sap` pointing at the virtual address `x`.

<a id="x-28SB-SYS-3ASAP-REF-32-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-sys:sap-ref-32** *sap offset*

    Access the value of the memory location at `offset` bytes from `sap`. [`setf`][a138]able.

<a id="x-28SB-SYS-3ASAP-3D-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-sys:sap=** *x y*

    Compare the `sap`s `x` and `y` for equality.

Similarly named functions exist for accessing other sizes of word,
other comparisons, and other conversions. The reader is invited to
use [`apropos`][b5f2] and [`describe`][6651] for more details:

    (apropos "sap" :sb-sys)


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40COERCING-FOREIGN-VALUES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 9.3.2 Coercing Foreign Values

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3AADDR-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **addr** *expr*

    Return an Alien pointer to the data addressed by `expr`,
    which must be a foreign variable, a call to [`deref`][85de] or [`slot`][6f5c], or a use
    of [`extern-alien`][3986].

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3ACAST-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **cast** *alien type*

    Convert `alien` to an Alien of the specified `type` (not evaluated).
    Both types must be Alien array, pointer or function types.
    
    Note that the resulting Lisp foreign variable object is not [`eq`][5a82] to
    the argument, but it points to the same foreign memory address.

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3ASAP-ALIEN-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sap-alien** *sap type*

    Convert the `system-area-pointer` `sap` to an `alien` of the specified
    `type` (not evaluated). `type` must be pointer-like (foreign pointer,
    array, or record type).

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3AALIEN-SAP-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **alien-sap** *alien*

    Return a `system-area-pointer` pointing to `alien`'s data.
    `alien` must be of some foreign pointer, array, or record type.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40FOREIGN-DYNAMIC-ALLOCATION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 9.3.3 Foreign Dynamic Allocation

Lisp code can call the C standard library functions `malloc`
and `free` to dynamically allocate and deallocate foreign variables.
The Lisp code uses the same allocator as foreign C code, so it's
OK for foreign code to call `free` on the result of Lisp [`make-alien`][fb92],
or for Lisp code to call [`free-alien`][95c1] on foreign objects allocated by
C code.

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3AMAKE-ALIEN-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **make-alien** *type &optional size*

    Allocate an alien of type `type` in foreign heap, and return an alien
    pointer to it. The allocated memory is not initialized, and may
    contain garbage. The memory is allocated using `malloc(3)`, so it can
    be passed to foreign functions which use `free(3)`, or released using
    [`free-alien`][95c1].
    
    For alien stack allocation, see macro [`with-alien`][3ae4].
    
    The `type` argument is not evaluated. If `size` is supplied, how it is
    interpreted depends on `type`:
    
    - When `type` is a foreign array type, an array of that type is
      allocated, and a pointer to it is returned. Note that you must use
      [`deref`][85de] to first access the array through the pointer.
    
        If supplied, `size` is used as the first dimension for the array.
    
    - When `type` is any other foreign type, then an object for that type is
      allocated, and a pointer to it is returned. So
      (`make-alien` `int`) returns a (\* `int`).
    
        If `size` is specified, then a block of that many objects is
        allocated, with the result pointing to the first one.
    
    Examples:
    
        (defvar *foo* (make-alien (array char 10)))
        (type-of *foo*)                   ; => (alien (* (array (signed 8) 10)))
        (setf (deref (deref *foo*) 0) 10) ; => 10
        
        (make-alien char 12)              ; => (alien (* (signed 8)))

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3AMAKE-ALIEN-STRING-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **make-alien-string** *string &rest rest &key (start 0) end (external-format :default) (null-terminate t)*

    Copy part of `string` delimited by `start` and `end` into freshly
    allocated foreign memory, freeable using `free(3)` or [`free-alien`][95c1].
    Returns the allocated string as a (\* [`char`][ee36]) alien, and the number of
    bytes allocated as secondary value.
    
    The string is encoded using `external-format`. If `null-terminate` is
    true (the default), the alien string is terminated by an additional
    null byte.

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3AFREE-ALIEN-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **free-alien** *alien*

    Dispose of the storage pointed to by `alien`. The `alien` must have been
    allocated by [`make-alien`][fb92], [`make-alien-string`][de0a] or `malloc(3)`.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40FOREIGN-VARIABLES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 9.4 Foreign Variables

Both local (stack allocated) and external (C global) foreign
variables are supported.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40LOCAL-FOREIGN-VARIABLES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 9.4.1 Local Foreign Variables

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3AWITH-ALIEN-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **with-alien** *bindings &body body*

    Establish some local alien variables of dynamic extent.
    Each of `bindings` is of the form:
    
         VAR TYPE [ ALLOCATION ] [ INITIAL-VALUE | EXTERNAL-NAME ]
    
    `allocation` should be one of:
    
    - `:local` (the default): The alien is allocated on the stack, and
     has dynamic extent.
    
    - `:extern`: No alien is allocated, but `var` is established as a
     local name for the external alien given by `external-name`.
    
    `var`s are established as symbol-macros; the bindings have lexical
    scope, and may be assigned with [`setq`][0160] or [`setf`][a138].
    
    The `with-alien` macro also establishes a new scope for named
    structures and unions. Any [`type`][7c9f] specified for a variable may contain
    named structure or union types with the slots specified. Within the
    lexical scope of the binding specifiers and body, a locally defined
    foreign structure type `foo` can be referenced by its name using
    `(struct foo)`.
    
    When a foreign function returns a structure by value, using
    [`alien-funcall`][c886] as the `initial-value` allows the returned struct to
    be stack-allocated directly into the local variable's storage,
    avoiding heap allocation:
    
        (with-alien ((result (struct point)
                             (alien-funcall
                              (extern-alien "make_point"
                                            (function (struct point) double double))
                              1.0d0 2.0d0)))
          (values (slot result 'x) (slot result 'y)))

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40EXTERNAL-FOREIGN-VARIABLES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 9.4.2 External Foreign Variables

External foreign names are strings, and Lisp names are symbols. When
an external foreign value is represented using a Lisp variable, there
must be a way to convert from one name syntax into the other. The
macros [`extern-alien`][3986], [`define-alien-variable`][3ac6] and
[`define-alien-routine`][5da0] use this conversion heuristic:

- Alien names are converted to Lisp names by uppercasing and
  replacing underscores with hyphens.

- Conversely, Lisp names are converted to alien names by lowercasing
  and replacing hyphens with underscores.

- Both the Lisp symbol and alien string names may be separately
  specified by using a list of the form

        (<alien-string> <lisp-symbol>)


<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3ADEFINE-ALIEN-VARIABLE-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **define-alien-variable** *name type*

    Define `name` as an external alien variable of type `type`.
    Neither is evaluated.
    
    In its full form, `name` is `(<alien-name-string>
    <lisp-name-symbol>)`. If `name` is just a symbol or string, then the
    other name is guessed from the one supplied as described
    [External Foreign Variables][2e9a].
    
    The Lisp name of the variable becomes a global alien variable.
    Global alien variables are effectively "global symbol macros"; a
    reference to the variable fetches the contents of the external
    variable. Similarly, setting the variable stores new contents -- the
    new contents must be of the declared `type`. Someday, they may well be
    implemented using the ANSI [`define-symbol-macro`][46c0] mechanism, but as of
    SBCL 0.7.5, they are still implemented using an older more-or-less
    parallel mechanism inherited from CMUCL.
    
    For example, to access a C-level counter `foo`, one could write
    
        (define-alien-variable "foo" int)
        ;; Now it is possible to get the value of the C variable foo simply by
        ;; referencing that Lisp variable:
        (print foo)
        (setf foo 14)
        (incf foo)

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3AGET-ERRNO-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **get-errno**

    Return the value of the C library pseudo-variable named `errno`.
    
    Since in modern C libraries, `errno` is typically no longer a
    variable, but some bizarre artificial construct which behaves
    superficially like a variable within a given thread, it can no longer
    reliably be accessed through the ordinary [`define-alien-variable`][3ac6]
    mechanism.

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3AEXTERN-ALIEN-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **extern-alien** *name type*

    Return an alien of `type` which points to an externally defined value of `name`.
    `name` is not evaluated and may be either a string or a symbol. `type`
    is an unevaluated alien type specifier. [`setf`][a138]able.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40FOREIGN-DATA-STRUCTURE-EXAMPLES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 9.5 Foreign Data Structure Examples

Now that we have alien types, operations and variables, we can
manipulate foreign data structures. This C declaration

    struct foo {
        int a;
        struct foo *b[100];
    };

can be translated into the following alien type:

    (define-alien-type nil
      (struct foo
        (a int)
        (b (array (* (struct foo)) 100))))

Once the `foo` alien type has been defined as above, the C
expression

    struct foo f;
    f.b[7].a;

can be translated in this way:

    (with-alien ((f (struct foo)))
      (slot (deref (slot f 'b) 7) 'a)
      ;;
      ;; Do something with f...
      )

Or consider this example of an external C variable and some accesses:

    struct c_struct {
            short x, y;
            char a, b;
            int z;
            c_struct *n;
    };
    extern struct c_struct *my_struct;
    my_struct->x++;
    my_struct->a = 5;
    my_struct = my_struct->n;

which can be manipulated in Lisp like this:

    (define-alien-type nil
      (struct c-struct
              (x short)
              (y short)
              (a char)
              (b char)
              (z int)
              (n (* c-struct))))
    (define-alien-variable "my_struct" (* c-struct))
    (incf (slot my-struct 'x))
    (setf (slot my-struct 'a) 5)
    (setq my-struct (slot my-struct 'n))


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40LOADING-SHARED-OBJECT-FILES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 9.6 Loading Shared Object Files

Foreign object files can be loaded into the running Lisp process by
calling [`load-shared-object`][3c84].

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3ALOAD-SHARED-OBJECT-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **load-shared-object** *pathname &key dont-save*

    Load a shared library / dynamic shared object file / similar foreign
    container specified by designated `pathname`, such as a .so on an ELF platform.
    
    Locating the shared object follows standard rules of the platform, consult the
    manual page for `dlopen(3)` for details. Typically paths specified by
    environment variables such as LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH are searched if the `pathname` has
    no directory, but on some systems (eg. Mac OS X) search may happen even if
    `pathname` is absolute. (On Windows LoadLibrary is used instead of `dlopen(3)`.)
    
    On non-Windows platforms calling `load-shared-object` again with a `pathname`
    [`equal`][3fb5] to the designated pathname of a previous call will replace the old
    definitions; if a symbol was previously referenced through the object and
    is not present in the reloaded version an error will be signalled. Reloading
    may not work as expected if user or library-code has called `dlopen(3)` on the
    same shared object or running on a system where `dlclose(3)` is a noop.
    
    `load-shared-object` interacts with [`sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die`][9e55]:
    
    1. If `dont-save` is true (default is `nil`), the shared object will be dropped
    when `save-lisp-and-die` is called -- otherwise shared objects are reloaded
    automatically when a saved core starts up. Specifying `dont-save` can be useful
    when the location of the shared object on startup is uncertain.
    
    2. On most platforms references in compiled code to foreign symbols in shared
    objects (such as those generated by [`define-alien-routine`][5da0]) remain valid across
    `save-lisp-and-die`. On those platforms where this is not supported, a [`warning`][bcb6]
    will be signalled when the core is saved -- this is orthogonal from `dont-save`.

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3AUNLOAD-SHARED-OBJECT-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **unload-shared-object** *pathname*

    Unloads the shared object loaded earlier using the designated `pathname` with
    [`load-shared-object`][3c84], to the degree supported on the platform.
    
    Experimental.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40FOREIGN-FUNCTION-CALLS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 9.7 Foreign Function Calls

The foreign function call interface allows a Lisp program to call
many functions written in languages that use the C calling convention.

Lisp sets up various signal handling routines and other environment
information when it first starts up, and expects these to be in
place at all times. The C functions called by Lisp should not change
the environment, especially the signal handlers: the signal handlers
installed by Lisp typically have interesting flags set (e.g to
request machine context information, or for signal delivery on an
alternate stack) which the Lisp runtime relies on for correct
operation. Precise details of how this works may change without
notice between versions; the source, or the brain of a friendly SBCL
developer, is the only documentation. Users of a Lisp built with the
`:sb-thread` feature should also read the section about threads,
[Threading][6ec7].

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3AALIEN-FUNCALL-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **alien-funcall** *alien &rest args*

    Call the foreign function `alien` with `args` and return its C return value
    as a Lisp value. `alien`'s foreign type specifies the argument and
    result types. `alien` is typically an [`extern-alien`][3986] or a value defined
    with [`define-alien-routine`][5da0].
    
    The type of `alien` must be `(alien (function ...))` or `(alien
    (* (function ...)))`. The function type is used to determine how to
    call the function (as though it was declared with a prototype). The
    type need not be known at compile time, but only known-type calls
    are efficiently compiled.
    
    On Unix-like x86-64 and ARM64 systems, structures may be passed and
    returned by value. The implementation follows the System V AMD64 ABI
    and AAPCS64 specifications respectively.
    
    Here is an example which allocates a `(struct foo)`, calls a foreign
    function to initialize it, then returns a Lisp vector of all
    the `(* (struct foo))` objects filled in by the foreign call:
    
        ;; Allocate a foo on the stack.
        (with-alien ((f (struct foo)))
          ;; Call some C function to fill in foo fields.
          (alien-funcall (extern-alien "mangle_foo" (function void (* foo)))
                         (addr f))
          ;; Find how many foos to use by getting the A field.
          (let* ((num (slot f 'a))
                 (result (make-array num)))
            ;; Get a pointer to the array so that we don't have to keep extracting it:
            (with-alien ((a (* (array (* (struct foo)) 100)) (addr (slot f 'b))))
              ;; Loop over the first N elements and stash them in the result vector.
              (dotimes (i num)
                (setf (svref result i) (deref (deref a) i)))
              ;; Voila.
              result)))

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3AALIEN-FUNCALL-INTO-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **alien-funcall-into** *alien result-buffer &rest args*

    Call the foreign function `alien`, writing the struct result to `result-buffer`.
    Returns no values.
    
    `result-buffer` should be a `system-area-pointer` to appropriately sized memory.
    Only supported on x86-64 and ARM64.
    
    Here is an example that calls a C function returning a struct, writing
    the result to a stack-allocated buffer:
    
        (define-alien-type nil (struct point (x double) (y double)))
        
        (with-alien ((result (struct point)))
          (alien-funcall-into
           (extern-alien "make_point"
                         (function (struct point) double double))
           (alien-sap (addr result))
           1.0d0 2.0d0)
          (values (slot result 'x) (slot result 'y)))

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3ADEFINE-ALIEN-ROUTINE-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **define-alien-routine** *name result-type &rest args*

    Define a foreign interface function for the routine with the specified `name`.
    Also automatically [`declaim`][ebea] the [`ftype`][05c1] of the defined function. The
    semantics of the actual call are the same as for [`alien-funcall`][c886].
    
    This macro is a convenience for automatically generating Lisp
    interfaces to simple foreign functions. The primary feature is the
    parameter style specification, which translates the C
    pass-by-reference idiom into additional return values.
    
    `name` may be either a string, a symbol, or a list of the
    form `(<foreign-name-string> <lisp-name-symbol>)`.
    
    `result-type` is the alien type for the function return value. `void` may be
    used to specify a function with no result.
    
    `args` is a list of `(arg-name arg-type &optional style)` elements.
    `arg-name` is a symbol that names the argument, primarily for
    documentation. `arg-type` is the C type of the argument.
    
    `style` specifies the way that the argument is passed:
    
    - `:in`: An `:in` argument is simply passed by value. The value to be
      passed is obtained from argument(s) to the interface function. No
      values are returned for `:in` arguments. This is the default mode.
    
    - `:out`: A pass-by-reference output value. The specified argument type
      must be a pointer to a fixed sized object. An object of the correct
      size is allocated on the stack, and its address is passed to the
      foreign function. When the function returns, the contents of this
      location are returned as one of the values of the Lisp function (and
      the location is automatically deallocated). `:out` and `:in-out` cannot
      be used with pointers to arrays, records or functions.
    
    - `:copy`: This is similar to `:in`, except that the argument values are
      stored on the stack, and a pointer to the object is passed instead
      of the value itself.
    
    - `:in-out`: This is a combination of `:out` and `:copy`. A pointer to the
      argument is passed, with the object being initialized from the
      supplied argument and the return value being determined by accessing
      the object on return.
    
    > *Note*: Any efficiency-critical foreign interface function should be
    > inline expanded, which can be done by preceding the
    > `define-alien-routine` call with:
    
    >     (declaim (inline lisp-name))
    
    > In addition to avoiding the Lisp call overhead, this allows
    > pointers, word-integers and floats to be passed using non-descriptor
    > representations, avoiding consing.
    
    Consider the C function `cfoo` with the following calling
    convention:
    
        void
        cfoo (str, a, i)
            char *str;
            char *a; /* update */
            int *i; /* out */
        {
          /* body of cfoo(...) */
        }
    
    This can be described by the following call to `define-alien-routine`:
    
        (define-alien-routine "cfoo" void
          (str c-string)
          (a char :in-out)
          (i int :out))
    
    The Lisp function `cfoo` will have two arguments (`str` and `a`) and
    two return values (`a` and `i`).

### 9.8 Calling Lisp From C

SBCL supports the calling of Lisp functions using the C calling
convention. This is useful for both defining callbacks and for creating
an interface for calling into Lisp as a shared library directly from C.

The [`define-alien-callable`][d32d] macro wraps Lisp code and creates a C
foreign function which can be called with the C calling convention.
On x86-64 and ARM64, callbacks may receive and return structures by
value.

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3ADEFINE-ALIEN-CALLABLE-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **define-alien-callable** *name result-type typed-lambda-list &body body*

    Define an alien function which can be called by alien code. The alien
    function returned by ([`alien-callable-function`][a887] `name`) expects alien
    arguments of the specified `arg-type`s and returns an alien of type
    `result-type`.
    
    `typed-lambda-list` is a list of `(arg-name arg-type)` elements, and
    `body` is `{doc-string} {decl}* {form}*`.
    
    If (`alien-callable-function` `name`) already exists, its value is not
    changed (though it is arranged that an updated version of the Lisp
    callable function will be called, provided that the new type and the
    existing type are compatible). This feature allows for incremental
    redefinition of callable functions.

The [`alien-callable-function`][a887] function returns the foreign callable
value associated with any name defined by [`define-alien-callable`][d32d], so
that we can, for example, pass the callable value to C as a
callback.

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3AALIEN-CALLABLE-FUNCTION-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **alien-callable-function** *name*

    Return the alien callable function associated with `name`.

The [`with-alien-callable`][79f8] macro wraps Lisp code and establishes
local C foreign functions which can be called with the C calling
convention. This macro is handy for passing callbacks which close over
Lisp values into C.

<a id="x-28SB-ALIEN-3AWITH-ALIEN-CALLABLE-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **with-alien-callable** *definitions &body body*

    Establish some local alien functions.
    Each element of `definitions` is of the form:
    
        NAME RESULT-TYPE {(ARG-NAME ARG-TYPE)}* {DOC-STRING} {DECL}* {FORM}*
    
    The resulting alien callable value has dynamic extent.

Note that the garbage collector moves objects, and won't be able to fix
up any references in C variables. There are three mechanisms for
coping with this:

- `sb-ext:purify` moves all live Lisp data into static or read-only
  areas such that it will never be moved (or freed) again in the
  life of the Lisp session

- `sb-sys:with-pinned-objects` is a macro which arranges for some set
  of objects to be pinned in memory for the dynamic extent of its
  body forms. On ports which use the generational GC
  (most, as of this writing) this affects exactly the specified
  objects. On other ports it is implemented by turning off GC for
  the duration (so could be said to have a whole-world granularity).

- Disable GC, using the SB-EXT:WITHOUT-GCING macro.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40LISP-AS-A-SHARED-LIBRARY-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 9.8.1 Lisp as a Shared Library

SBCL supports the use of Lisp as a shared library that can be used by
C programs using the [`define-alien-callable`][d32d] interface. See the
`:callable-exports` argument of [`sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die`][9e55] for how to
save the Lisp image in a way that allows a C program to initialize
the Lisp runtime and the exported symbols. When SBCL is built as a
library, it exposes the symbol `initialize_lisp` which can be used
in conjunction with a core initializing global symbols to foreign
callables as function pointers and with object code allocating those
symbols to initialize the runtime properly. The arguments to
`initialize_lisp` are the same as the arguments to the main `sbcl`
program.

> *Note*: There is currently no way to run exit hooks or otherwise
> undo Lisp initialization gracefully from C.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40STEP-BY-STEP-EXAMPLE-OF-THE-FOREIGN-FUNCTION-INTERFACE-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 9.9 Step-By-Step Example of the Foreign Function Interface

This section presents a complete example of an interface to a somewhat
complicated C function.

Suppose you have the following C function which you want to be able
to call from Lisp in the file `test.c`:

    struct c_struct
    {
      int x;
      char *s;
    };
    
    struct c_struct *c_function (i, s, r, a)
        int i;
        char *s;
        struct c_struct *r;
        int a[10];
    {
      int j;
      struct c_struct *r2;
    
      printf("i = %dn", i);
      printf("s = %sn", s);
      printf("r->x = %dn", r->x);
      printf("r->s = %sn", r->s);
      for (j = 0; j < 10; j++) printf("a[%d] = %d.n", j, a[j]);
      r2 = (struct c_struct *) malloc (sizeof(struct c_struct));
      r2->x = i + 5;
      r2->s = "a C string";
      return(r2);
    };

It is possible to call this C function from Lisp using the file
`test.lisp` containing

    (cl:defpackage "TEST-C-CALL" (:use "CL" "SB-ALIEN" "SB-C-CALL"))
    (cl:in-package "TEST-C-CALL")
    
    ;;; Define the record C-STRUCT in Lisp.
    (define-alien-type nil
        (struct c-struct
                (x int)
                (s c-string)))
    
    ;;; Define the Lisp function interface to the C routine.  It returns a
    ;;; pointer to a record of type C-STRUCT.  It accepts four parameters:
    ;;; I, an int; S, a pointer to a string; R, a pointer to a C-STRUCT
    ;;; record; and A, a pointer to the array of 10 ints.
    ;;;
    ;;; The INLINE declaration eliminates some efficiency notes about heap
    ;;; allocation of alien values.
    (declaim (inline c-function))
    (define-alien-routine c-function
        (* (struct c-struct))
      (i int)
      (s c-string)
      (r (* (struct c-struct)))
      (a (array int 10)))
    
    ;;; a function which sets up the parameters to the C function and
    ;;; actually calls it
    (defun call-cfun ()
      (with-alien ((ar (array int 10))
                   (c-struct (struct c-struct)))
        (dotimes (i 10)                     ; Fill array.
          (setf (deref ar i) i))
        (setf (slot c-struct 'x) 20)
        (setf (slot c-struct 's) "a Lisp string")
    
        (with-alien ((res (* (struct c-struct))
                          (c-function 5 "another Lisp string" (addr c-struct) ar)))
          (format t "~&back from C function~%")
          (multiple-value-prog1
              (values (slot res 'x)
                      (slot res 's))
    
            ;; Deallocate result. (after we are done referring to it:
            ;; "Pillage, *then* burn.")
            (free-alien res)))))

To execute the above example, it is necessary to compile the C
routine, e.g. with `cc -c test.c && ld -shared -o test.so test.o`.
In order to enable incremental loading with some linkers, you may
need to say `cc -G 0 -c test.c`.

Once the C code has been compiled, you can start up Lisp and load it
in: `sbcl`. Lisp should start up with its normal prompt.

Within Lisp, compile the Lisp file:

    (compile-file "test.lisp")

This step can be done separately. You don't have to recompile every
time.

Within Lisp, load the foreign object file to define the necessary
symbols:

    (load-shared-object "test.so")

Now you can load the compiled Lisp (fasl) file into Lisp:

    (load "test.fasl")

And once the Lisp file is loaded, you can call the Lisp routine
that sets up the parameters and calls the C function:

    (test-c-call::call-cfun)

The C routine should print the following information to standard output:

    i = 5
    s = another Lisp string
    r->x = 20
    r->s = a Lisp string
    a[0] = 0.
    a[1] = 1.
    a[2] = 2.
    a[3] = 3.
    a[4] = 4.
    a[5] = 5.
    a[6] = 6.
    a[7] = 7.
    a[8] = 8.
    a[9] = 9.

After return from the C function,
the Lisp wrapper function should print the following output:

    back from C function

And upon return from the Lisp wrapper function,
before the next prompt is printed, the
Lisp read-eval-print loop should print the following return values:

    10
    "a C string"

## 10 Pathnames

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40LISP-PATHNAMES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 10.1 Lisp Pathnames

There are many aspects of ANSI Common Lisp's pathname support
which are implementation-defined and so need documentation.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40HOME-DIRECTORY-SPECIFIERS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 10.1.1 Home Directory Specifiers

SBCL accepts the keyword `:home` and a list of the form
`(:home` `"username")` as a directory component immediately
following `:absolute`.

`:home` is represented in namestrings by `~/` and `(:home`
`"username")` by `~username/` at the start of the namestring.
Tilde-characters elsewhere in namestrings represent themselves.

Home directory specifiers are resolved to home directory of the
current or specified user by [`sb-ext:native-namestring`][6b7c], which is used
by the implementation to translate pathnames before passing them on
to operating system specific routines.

Using `(:home` `"user")` form on Windows signals an error.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40THE-SYS-LOGICAL-PATHNAME-HOST-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 10.1.2 The SYS Logical Pathname Host

The logical pathname host named by `"SYS"` exists in SBCL.
Its [`logical-pathname-translations`][8a67] may be set by the site or the user
applicable to point to the locations of the system's sources; in
particular, the core system's source files match the logical
pathname `"SYS:SRC;**;*.*.*"`, and the contributed modules' source
files match `"SYS:CONTRIB;**;*.*.*"`.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ASET-SBCL-SOURCE-LOCATION-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:set-sbcl-source-location** *pathname*

    Initialize the `SYS` logical host based on `pathname`, which should
    be the top-level directory of the SBCL sources. This will replace any
    existing translations for `"SYS:SRC;"`, `"SYS:CONTRIB;"`, and
    `"SYS:OUTPUT;"`. Other `"SYS:"` translations are preserved.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40NATIVE-FILENAMES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 10.2 Native Filenames

In some circumstances, what is wanted is a Lisp pathname object which
corresponds to a string produced by the Operating System. In this
case, some of the default parsing rules are inappropriate: most
filesystems do not have a native understanding of wild pathnames;
such functionality is often provided by shells above the OS, often
in mutually-incompatible ways.

To allow the user to deal with this, the following functions are
provided: [`sb-ext:parse-native-namestring`][b77b] and [`sb-ext:native-pathname`][31ef]
return the closest equivalent Lisp pathname to a given string
(appropriate for the Operating System), while
[`sb-ext:native-namestring`][6b7c] converts a non-wild pathname designator to
the equivalent native namestring, if possible. Some Lisp pathname
concepts (such as the `:back` directory component) have no direct
equivalents in most Operating Systems; the behaviour of
`sb-ext:native-namestring` is unspecified if an inappropriate pathname
designator is passed to it. Additionally, note that conversion from
pathname to native filename and back to pathname should not be
expected to preserve equivalence under [`equal`][3fb5].

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3APARSE-NATIVE-NAMESTRING-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:parse-native-namestring** *thing &optional host (defaults \*default-pathname-defaults\*) &key (start 0) end junk-allowed as-directory*

    Convert `thing` into a pathname, using the native conventions
    appropriate for the pathname host `host`, or if not specified the
    host of `defaults`.  If `thing` is a string, the parse is bounded by
    `start` and `end`, and error behaviour is controlled by `junk-allowed`,
    as with [`parse-namestring`][a22e].  For file systems whose native
    conventions allow directories to be indicated as files, if
    `as-directory` is true, return a pathname denoting `thing` as a
    directory.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ANATIVE-PATHNAME-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:native-pathname** *pathspec*

    Convert `pathspec` (a pathname designator) into a pathname, assuming
    the operating system native pathname conventions.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ANATIVE-NAMESTRING-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:native-namestring** *pathname &key as-file*

    Construct the full native (name)string form of `pathname`.  For
    file systems whose native conventions allow directories to be
    indicated as files, if `as-file` is true and the name, type, and
    version components of `pathname` are all `nil` or `:unspecific`,
    construct a string that names the directory according to the file
    system's syntax for files.

Because some file systems permit the names of directories to be
expressed in multiple ways, it is occasionally necessary to parse a
native file name as a directory name or to produce a native file
name that names a directory as a file. For these cases,
PARSE-NATIVE-NAMESTRING accepts the keyword argument
`:as-directory` to force a filename to parse as a directory, and
[`sb-ext:native-namestring`][6b7c] accepts the keyword argument `:as-file`
to force a pathname to unparse as a file. For example,

    ; On Unix, the directory "/tmp/" can be denoted by "/tmp/" or "/tmp".
    ; Under the default rules for native filenames, these parse and
    ; unparse differently.
    (defvar *p*)
    (setf *p* (parse-native-namestring "/tmp/")) => #P"/tmp/"
    (pathname-name *p*) => NIL
    (pathname-directory *p*) => (:ABSOLUTE "tmp")
    (native-namestring *p*) => "/tmp/"
    
    (setf *p* (parse-native-namestring "/tmp")) => #P"/tmp"
    (pathname-name *p*) => "tmp"
    (pathname-directory *p*) => (:ABSOLUTE)
    (native-namestring *p*) => "/tmp"
    
    ; A non-NIL AS-DIRECTORY argument to PARSE-NATIVE-NAMESTRING forces
    ; both the second string to parse the way the first does.
    (setf *p* (parse-native-namestring "/tmp"
                                       nil *default-pathname-defaults*
                                       :as-directory t)) => #P"/tmp/"
    (pathname-name *p*) => NIL
    (pathname-directory *p*) => (:ABSOLUTE "tmp")
    
    ; A non-NIL AS-FILE argument to NATIVE-NAMESTRING forces the pathname
    ; parsed from the first string to unparse as the second string.
    (setf *p* (parse-native-namestring "/tmp/")) => #P"/tmp/"
    (native-namestring *p* :as-file t) => "/tmp"


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40STREAMS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

## 11 Streams

Streams which read or write Lisp character data from or to the outside
world -- files, sockets or other external entities -- require the
specification of a conversion between the external, binary data and
the Lisp characters. In ANSI Common Lisp, this is done by specifying
the `:external-format` argument when the stream is created. The major
information required is an *encoding*, specified by a keyword naming
that encoding; however, it is also possible to specify refinements
to that encoding as additional options to the external format
designator.

In addition, SBCL supports various extensions of ANSI Common Lisp
streams:

- *Bivalent Streams*: A type of stream that can read and write both
  [`character`][0a49] and `(unsigned-byte 8)` values.

- *Gray Streams*: User-overloadable CLOS classes whose instances can
  be used as Lisp streams (e.g. passed as the first argument to
  [`format`][ad78]).

- *Simple Streams*: The bundled contrib module `sb-simple-streams`
  implements a subset of the Franz Allegro simple-streams proposal.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40STREAM-EXTERNAL-FORMATS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 11.1 Stream External Formats

The function [`stream-external-format`][3d00] returns the canonical name of
the external format (see [External Formats][d293]) used by the stream for
character-based input and/or output.

When constructing file streams, for example using [`open`][6547] or
[`with-open-file`][9ac2], the external format to use is specified via the
`:external-format` argument which accepts an external format
designator (see [External Format Designators][d283]).

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40BIVALENT-STREAMS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 11.2 Bivalent Streams

A *bivalent stream* can be used to read and write both
[`character`][0a49] and `(unsigned-byte 8)` values. A bivalent stream is
created by calling [`open`][6547] with the argument `:element-type`
`:default`. On such a stream, both binary and character data can be
read and written with the usual input and output functions.

Streams are *not* created bivalent by default for performance
reasons. Bivalent streams are incompatible with `fast-read-char`, an
internal optimization in SBCL's stream machinery that bulk-converts
octets to characters and implements a fast path through [`read-char`][dd7a].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40GRAY-STREAMS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 11.3 Gray Streams

The Gray Streams interface is a widely supported extension that
provides for definition of CLOS-extensible stream classes. Gray
stream classes are implemented by adding methods to generic
functions analogous to Common Lisp's standard I/O functions.
Instances of Gray stream classes may be used with any I/O operation
where a non-Gray stream can, provided that all required methods have
been implemented suitably.

#### 11.3.1 Gray Streams classes

The defined Gray Stream classes are these:

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3AFUNDAMENTAL-STREAM-20CLASS-29"></a>

- [class] **sb-gray:fundamental-stream** *[stream][d5a9]*

    Base class for all Gray streams.

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3AFUNDAMENTAL-INPUT-STREAM-20CLASS-29"></a>

- [class] **sb-gray:fundamental-input-stream** *[sb-gray:fundamental-stream][93f4]*

    Superclass of all Gray input streams.

The function [`input-stream-p`][9236] will return true of any generalized
instance of [`sb-gray:fundamental-input-stream`][5667].

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3AFUNDAMENTAL-OUTPUT-STREAM-20CLASS-29"></a>

    Superclass of all Gray streams whose element-type
    is a subtype of unsigned-byte or signed-byte.

Note that instantiable subclasses of [`sb-gray:fundamental-binary-stream`][e5a1]
should provide (or inherit) an applicable method for the generic
function [`stream-element-type`][8cb6].

    Superclass of all Gray input streams whose element-type
    is a subtype of character.

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3AFUNDAMENTAL-CHARACTER-OUTPUT-STREAM-20CLASS-29"></a>

- [class] **sb-gray:fundamental-character-output-stream** *[sb-gray:fundamental-output-stream][87b6] [sb-gray:fundamental-character-stream][0357]*

    Superclass of all Gray output streams whose element-type
    is a subtype of character.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40METHODS-COMMON-TO-ALL-STREAMS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 11.3.2 Methods common to all streams

These generic functions can be specialized on any generalized instance
of fundamental-stream.

<a id="x-28STREAM-ELEMENT-TYPE-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **stream-element-type** *stream*

    Return a type specifier for the kind of object returned by the
    `stream`. The class [`sb-gray:fundamental-character-stream`][0357] provides a
    default method which returns [`character`][0a49].

    Also, see the [CLHS][116c].

<a id="x-28CLOSE-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **close** *stream &key abort*

    Close the given `stream`. No more I/O may be performed, but
    inquiries may still be made. If `:abort` is true, an attempt is made
    to clean up the side effects of having created the stream.

    Also, see the [CLHS][0d02].

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-FILE-POSITION-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-file-position** *stream &optional position-spec*

    Used by [`file-position`][6f95]. Returns or changes the current position within `stream`.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40INPUT-STREAM-METHODS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 11.3.3 Input stream methods

These generic functions may be specialized on any generalized instance
of fundamental-input-stream.

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-CLEAR-INPUT-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-clear-input** *stream*

    This is like [`cl:clear-input`][56f5], but for Gray streams, returning `nil`.
    The default method does nothing.

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-READ-SEQUENCE-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-read-sequence** *stream seq &optional start end*

    This is like [`cl:read-sequence`][4482], but for Gray streams.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40CHARACTER-INPUT-STREAM-METHODS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 11.3.4 Character input stream methods

These generic functions are used to implement subclasses of
[`sb-gray:fundamental-input-stream`][5667]:

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-PEEK-CHAR-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-peek-char** *stream*

    This is used to implement [`peek-char`][9fbc]; this corresponds to `peek-type`
    of `nil`. It returns either a character or `:eof`. The default method
    calls [`stream-read-char`][61cd] and [`stream-unread-char`][5686].

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-READ-CHAR-NO-HANG-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-read-char-no-hang** *stream*

    This is used to implement [`read-char-no-hang`][3a4f]. It returns either a
    character, or `nil` if no input is currently available, or `:eof` if
    end-of-file is reached. The default method provided by
    [`fundamental-character-input-stream`][d6aa] simply calls [`stream-read-char`][61cd]; this
    is sufficient for file streams, but interactive streams should define
    their own method.

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-READ-CHAR-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-read-char** *stream*

    Read one character from the stream. Return either a
    character object, or the symbol `:eof` if the stream is at end-of-file.
    Every subclass of [`fundamental-character-input-stream`][d6aa] must define a
    method for this function.

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-READ-LINE-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-read-line** *stream*

    This is used by [`read-line`][8a51]. A string is returned as the first value. The
    second value is true if the string was terminated by end-of-file
    instead of the end of a line. The default method uses repeated
    calls to [`stream-read-char`][61cd].

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-LISTEN-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-listen** *stream*

    This is used by [`listen`][ae5f]. It returns true or false. The default method uses
    [`stream-read-char-no-hang`][fe40] and [`stream-unread-char`][5686]. Most streams should
    define their own method since it will usually be trivial and will
    always be more efficient than the default method.

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-UNREAD-CHAR-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-unread-char** *stream character*

    Undo the last call to [`stream-read-char`][61cd], as in [`unread-char`][9cc8].
    Return `nil`. Every subclass of [`fundamental-character-input-stream`][d6aa]
    must define a method for this function.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40OUTPUT-STREAM-METHODS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 11.3.5 Output stream methods

These generic functions are used to implement subclasses of
[`sb-gray:fundamental-output-stream`][87b6]:

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-CLEAR-OUTPUT-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-clear-output** *stream*

    This is like [`cl:clear-output`][13dd], but for Gray streams: clear the given
    output `stream`. The default method does nothing.

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-FINISH-OUTPUT-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-finish-output** *stream*

    Attempts to ensure that all output sent to the Stream has reached
    its destination, and only then returns false. Implements
    [`finish-output`][3498]. The default method does nothing.

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-FORCE-OUTPUT-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-force-output** *stream*

    Attempts to force any buffered output to be sent. Implements
    [`force-output`][5842]. The default method does nothing.

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-WRITE-SEQUENCE-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-write-sequence** *stream seq &optional start end*

    This is like [`cl:write-sequence`][9ef0], but for Gray streams.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40CHARACTER-OUTPUT-STREAM-METHODS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 11.3.6 Character output stream methods

These generic functions are used to implement subclasses of
[`sb-gray:fundamental-character-output-stream`][bb44]:

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-ADVANCE-TO-COLUMN-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-advance-to-column** *stream column*

    Write enough blank space so that the next character will be
    written at the specified column. Returns true if the operation is
    successful, or `nil` if it is not supported for this stream. This is
    intended for use by by [`pprint`][6af6] and [`format`][ad78] `~t`. The default method
    uses [`stream-line-column`][2205] and repeated calls to [`stream-write-char`][40ad]
    with a #`space` character; it returns `nil` if `stream-line-column`
    returns `nil`.

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-FRESH-LINE-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-fresh-line** *stream*

    Outputs a new line to the Stream if it is not positioned at the
    beginning of a line. Returns `t` if it output a new line, nil
    otherwise. Used by [`fresh-line`][3808]. The default method uses
    [`stream-start-line-p`][7a5c] and [`stream-terpri`][ae1f].

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-LINE-COLUMN-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-line-column** *stream*

    Return the column number where the next character
    will be written, or `nil` if that is not meaningful for this stream.
    The first column on a line is numbered 0. This function is used in
    the implementation of [`pprint`][6af6] and the [`format`][ad78] `~t` directive. For every
    character output stream class that is defined, a method must be
    defined for this function, although it is permissible for it to
    always return `nil`.

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-LINE-LENGTH-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-line-length** *stream*

    Return the stream line length or `nil`.

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-START-LINE-P-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-start-line-p** *stream*

    Is `stream` known to be positioned at the beginning of a line?
    It is permissible for an implementation to always return
    `nil`. This is used in the implementation of [`fresh-line`][3808]. Note that
    while a value of 0 from [`stream-line-column`][2205] also indicates the
    beginning of a line, there are cases where `stream-start-line-p` can be
    meaningfully implemented although `stream-line-column` can't be. For
    example, for a window using variable-width characters, the column
    number isn't very meaningful, but the beginning of the line does have
    a clear meaning. The default method for `stream-start-line-p` on class
    [`fundamental-character-output-stream`][bb44] uses `stream-line-column`, so if
    that is defined to return `nil`, then a method should be provided for
    either `stream-start-line-p` or [`stream-fresh-line`][3289].

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-TERPRI-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-terpri** *stream*

    Writes an end of line, as for [`terpri`][bccf]. Returns `nil`. The default
    method does ([`stream-write-char`][40ad] stream `#\Newline`).

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-WRITE-CHAR-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-write-char** *stream character*

    Write `character` to `stream` and return `character`. Every
    subclass of [`fundamental-character-output-stream`][bb44] must have a method
    defined for this function.

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-WRITE-STRING-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-write-string** *stream string &optional start end*

    This is used by [`write-string`][1665]. It writes the string to the stream,
    optionally delimited by start and end, which default to 0 and `nil`.
    The string argument is returned. The default method provided by
    [`fundamental-character-output-stream`][bb44] uses repeated calls to
    [`stream-write-char`][40ad].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40BINARY-STREAM-METHODS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 11.3.7 Binary stream methods

The following generic functions are available for subclasses of
[`sb-gray:fundamental-binary-stream`][e5a1]:

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-READ-BYTE-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-read-byte** *stream*

    Used by [`read-byte`][e945]; returns either an integer, or the symbol `:eof`
    if the stream is at end-of-file.

<a id="x-28SB-GRAY-3ASTREAM-WRITE-BYTE-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-gray:stream-write-byte** *stream integer*

    Implements [`write-byte`][80ef]; writes the integer to the stream and
    returns the integer as the result.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40GRAY-STREAMS-EXAMPLES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 11.3.8 Gray Streams Examples

Below are two classes of stream that can be conveniently defined as
wrappers for Common Lisp streams. These are meant to serve as
examples of minimal implementations of the protocols that must be
followed when defining Gray streams. Realistic uses of the Gray
Streams API would implement the various methods that can do I/O in
batches, such as [`sb-gray:stream-read-line`][db73],
[`sb-gray:stream-write-string`][2b92], [`sb-gray:stream-read-sequence`][bac3], and
[`sb-gray:stream-write-sequence`][d240].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40CHARACTER-COUNTING-INPUT-STREAM-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

##### Character Counting Input Stream

It is occasionally handy for programs that process input files to
count the number of characters and lines seen so far, and the number
of characters seen on the current line, so that useful messages may
be reported in case of parsing errors, etc. Here is a character
input stream class that keeps track of these counts. Note that all
character input streams must implement [`sb-gray:stream-read-char`][61cd] and
[`sb-gray:stream-unread-char`][5686].

    (defclass wrapped-stream (fundamental-stream)
      ((stream :initarg :stream :reader stream-of)))
    
    (defmethod stream-element-type ((stream wrapped-stream))
      (stream-element-type (stream-of stream)))
    
    (defmethod close ((stream wrapped-stream) &key abort)
      (close (stream-of stream) :abort abort))
    
    (defclass wrapped-character-input-stream
        (wrapped-stream fundamental-character-input-stream)
      ())
    
    (defmethod stream-read-char ((stream wrapped-character-input-stream))
      (read-char (stream-of stream) nil :eof))
    
    (defmethod stream-unread-char ((stream wrapped-character-input-stream)
                                   char)
      (unread-char char (stream-of stream)))
    
    (defclass counting-character-input-stream
        (wrapped-character-input-stream)
      ((char-count :initform 1 :accessor char-count-of)
       (line-count :initform 1 :accessor line-count-of)
       (col-count :initform 1 :accessor col-count-of)
       (prev-col-count :initform 1 :accessor prev-col-count-of)))
    
    (defmethod stream-read-char ((stream counting-character-input-stream))
      (with-accessors ((inner-stream stream-of) (chars char-count-of)
                       (lines line-count-of) (cols col-count-of)
                       (prev prev-col-count-of)) stream
          (let ((char (call-next-method)))
            (cond ((eql char :eof)
                   :eof)
                  ((char= char #Newline)
                   (incf lines)
                   (incf chars)
                   (setf prev cols)
                   (setf cols 1)
                   char)
                  (t
                   (incf chars)
                   (incf cols)
                   char)))))
    
    (defmethod stream-unread-char ((stream counting-character-input-stream)
                                   char)
      (with-accessors ((inner-stream stream-of) (chars char-count-of)
                       (lines line-count-of) (cols col-count-of)
                       (prev prev-col-count-of)) stream
          (cond ((char= char #Newline)
                 (decf lines)
                 (decf chars)
                 (setf cols prev))
                (t
                 (decf chars)
                 (decf cols)
                 char))
          (call-next-method)))

The default methods for [`sb-gray:stream-read-char-no-hang`][fe40],
[`sb-gray:stream-peek-char`][4707], [`sb-gray:stream-listen`][c072],
[`sb-gray:stream-clear-input`][8a24], [`sb-gray:stream-read-line`][db73], and
[`sb-gray:stream-read-sequence`][bac3] should be sufficient (though the last
two will probably be slower than methods that forwarded directly).

Here's a sample use of this class:

    (with-input-from-string (input "1 2
     3 :foo  ")
      (let ((counted-stream (make-instance 'counting-character-input-stream
                             :stream input)))
        (loop for thing = (read counted-stream) while thing
           unless (numberp thing) do
             (error "Non-number ~S (line ~D, column ~D)" thing
                    (line-count-of counted-stream)
                    (- (col-count-of counted-stream)
                       (length (format nil "~S" thing))))
           end
           do (print thing))))

Output:

    1
    2
    3
    Non-number :FOO (line 2, column 5)
      [Condition of type SIMPLE-ERROR]


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40OUTPUT-PREFIXING-CHARACTER-STREAM-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

##### Output Prefixing Character Stream

One use for a wrapped output stream might be to prefix each line of
text with a timestamp, e.g. for a logging stream. Here's a simple
stream that does this, though without any fancy line-wrapping. Note
that all character output stream classes must implement
[`sb-gray:stream-write-char`][40ad] and [`sb-gray:stream-line-column`][2205].

    (defclass wrapped-stream (fundamental-stream)
      ((stream :initarg :stream :reader stream-of)))
    
    (defmethod stream-element-type ((stream wrapped-stream))
      (stream-element-type (stream-of stream)))
    
    (defmethod close ((stream wrapped-stream) &key abort)
      (close (stream-of stream) :abort abort))
    
    (defclass wrapped-character-output-stream
        (wrapped-stream fundamental-character-output-stream)
      ((col-index :initform 0 :accessor col-index-of)))
    
    (defmethod stream-line-column ((stream wrapped-character-output-stream))
      (col-index-of stream))
    
    (defmethod stream-write-char ((stream wrapped-character-output-stream)
                                  char)
      (with-accessors ((inner-stream stream-of) (cols col-index-of)) stream
        (write-char char inner-stream)
        (if (char= char #Newline)
            (setf cols 0)
            (incf cols))))
    
    (defclass prefixed-character-output-stream
        (wrapped-character-output-stream)
      ((prefix :initarg :prefix :reader prefix-of)))
    
    (defgeneric write-prefix (prefix stream)
      (:method ((prefix string) stream) (write-string prefix stream))
      (:method ((prefix function) stream) (funcall prefix stream)))
    
    (defmethod stream-write-char ((stream prefixed-character-output-stream)
                                  char)
      (with-accessors ((inner-stream stream-of) (cols col-index-of)
                       (prefix prefix-of)) stream
        (when (zerop cols)
          (write-prefix prefix inner-stream))
        (call-next-method)))

As with the example input stream, this implements only the minimal
protocol. A production implementation should also provide methods
for at least [`sb-gray:stream-write-string`][2b92],
[`sb-gray:stream-write-sequence`][d240].

And here's a sample use of this class:

    (flet ((format-timestamp (stream)
             (apply #'format stream "[~2@*~2,' D:~1@*~2,'0D:~0@*~2,'0D] "
                    (multiple-value-list (get-decoded-time)))))

### 11.4 Simple Streams

Simple streams are an extensible streams protocol that avoids some
problems with [Gray Streams][5165].

Documentation about simple streams is available at:

<http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/6.2/doc/streams.htm>

The implementation should be considered Alpha-quality; the basic
framework is there, but many classes are just stubs at the moment.

See `SYS:CONTRIB;SB-SIMPLE-STREAMS;SIMPLE-STREAM-TEST.LISP` for
things that should work.

Known differences to the ACL behaviour:

- `sb-simple-streams:open` does not return a `simple-stream` by
  default. See its `:class` argument.

- `write-vector` is unimplemented.

## 12 Package Locks

None of the following sections apply to SBCL built without package
locking support.

The interface described here is experimental: incompatible changes
in future SBCL releases are possible, even expected: the concept of
*implementation packages* and the associated operators may be
renamed; more operations (such as naming restarts or catch tags) may
be added to the list of operations violating package locks.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40PACKAGE-LOCK-CONCEPTS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 12.1 Package Lock Concepts

Package locks protect against unintentional modifications of a package:
they provide similar protection to user packages as is mandated to
`common-lisp` package by the ANSI specification. They are not, and
should not be used as, a security measure.

Newly created packages are by default unlocked (see the `:lock` option
to [`defpackage`][9b43]).

The package `common-lisp` and SBCL internal implementation packages
are locked by default, including `sb-ext`.

It may be beneficial to lock `common-lisp-user` as well, to ensure
that various libraries don't pollute it without asking, but this is
not currently done by default.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40IMPLEMENTATION-PACKAGES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 12.1.1 Implementation Packages

Each package has a list of associated implementation packages. A
locked package, and the symbols whose home package it is, can be
modified without violating package locks only when [`*package*`][5ed1] is
bound to one of the implementation packages of the locked package.

Unless explicitly altered by [`defpackage`][9b43],
[`sb-ext:add-implementation-package`][8e5b], or
[`sb-ext:remove-implementation-package`][2b94] each package is its own
(only) implementation package.

#### 12.1.2 Package Lock Violations

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40LEXICAL-BINDINGS-AND-DECLARATIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

##### Lexical Bindings and Declarations

Lexical bindings or declarations that violate package locks cause a
compile-time warning, and a runtime [`program-error`][9a70] when the form that
violates package locks would be executed.

A complete listing of operators affect by this is: [`let`][4853], [`let*`][49f5], [`flet`][091c],
[`labels`][c2ef], [`macrolet`][1383], and [`symbol-macrolet`][2eec], [`declare`][1574].

Package locks affecting both lexical bindings and declarations can
be disabled locally with the [`sb-ext:disable-package-locks`][6652]
declaration, and re-enabled with the [`sb-ext:enable-package-locks`][08cf]
declaration.

Example:

    (in-package :locked)
    
    (defun foo () ...)
    
    (defmacro with-foo (&body body)
      `(locally (declare (disable-package-locks locked:foo))
         (flet ((foo () ...))
           (declare (enable-package-locks locked:foo)) ; re-enable for body
           ,@body)))


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40OTHER-OPERATIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

##### Other Operations

If an non-lexical operation violates a package lock, a continuable
error that is of a subtype of [`sb-ext:package-lock-violation`][5685]
(subtype of [`package-error`][3ac8]) is signalled when the operation is
attempted.

Additional restarts may be established for continuable package lock
violations for interactive use.

The actual type of the error depends on circumstances that caused
the violation: operations on packages signal errors of type
[`sb-ext:package-locked-error`][16f8], and operations on symbols signal errors
of type [`sb-ext:symbol-package-locked-error`][c892].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40PACKAGE-LOCKS-IN-COMPILED-CODE-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 12.1.3 Package Locks in Compiled Code

If file-compiled code contains interned symbols, then loading that
code into an image without the said symbols will not cause a package
lock violation, even if the packages in question are locked.

With the exception of interned symbols, behaviour is unspecified if
package locks affecting compiled code are not the same during
loading of the code or execution.

Specifically, code compiled with packages unlocked may or may not
fail to signal package-lock-violations even if the packages are
locked at runtime, and code compiled with packages locked may or may
not signal spurious package-lock-violations at runtime even if the
packages are unlocked.

In practice all this means that package-locks have a negligible
performance penalty in compiled code as long as they are not
violated.

#### 12.1.4 Operations Violating Package Locks

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40OPERATIONS-ON-PACKAGES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

##### Operations on Packages

The following actions cause a package lock violation if the package
operated on is locked, and [`*package*`][5ed1] is not an implementation
package of that package, and the action would cause a change in the
state of the package (so e.g. exporting already external symbols is
never a violation). Package lock violations caused by these
operations signal errors of type [`sb-ext:package-locked-error`][16f8].

- Shadowing a symbol in a package.

- Importing a symbol to a package.

- Uninterning a symbol from a package.

- Exporting a symbol from a package.

- Unexporting a symbol from a package.

- Changing the packages used by a package.

- Renaming a package.

- Deleting a package.

- Adding a new package local nickname to a package.

- Removing an existing package local nickname to a package.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40OPERATIONS-ON-SYMBOLS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

##### Operations on Symbols

Following actions cause a package lock violation if the home package
of the symbol operated on is locked, and [`*package*`][5ed1] is not an
implementation package of that package. Package lock violations
caused by these action signal errors of type
[`sb-ext:symbol-package-locked-error`][c892].

These actions cause only one package lock violation per lexically
apparent violated package.

Example:

    ;;; Packages FOO and BAR are locked.
    ;;;
    ;;; Two lexically apparent violated packages: exactly two
    ;;; package-locked-errors will be signalled.
    
    (defclass foo:point ()
      ((x :accessor bar:x)
       (y :accessor bar:y)))

- Binding or altering its value lexically or dynamically, or
  establishing it as a symbol-macro.

    Exceptions:

    - If the symbol is not defined as a constant, global
      symbol-macro or a global dynamic variable, it may be lexically
      bound or established as a local symbol macro.

    - If the symbol is defined as a global dynamic variable, it may
      be assigned or bound.

- Defining, undefining, or binding it, or its setf name as a
  function.

    Exceptions:

    - If the symbol is not defined as a function, macro, or special
      operator it and its setf name may be lexically bound as a
      function.

- Defining, undefining, or binding it as a macro or compiler macro.

    Exceptions:

    - If the symbol is not defined as a function, macro, or special
      operator it may be lexically bound as a macro.

- Defining it as a type specifier or structure.

- Defining it as a declaration with a declaration proclamation.

- Declaring or proclaiming it special.

- Declaring or proclaiming its type or ftype.

    Exceptions:

    - If the symbol may be lexically bound, the type of that binding
      may be declared.

    - If the symbol may be lexically bound as a function, the ftype
      of that binding may be declared.

- Defining a setf expander for it.

- Defining it as a method combination type.

- Using it as the `class-name` argument to ([`setf`][a138] `find-class`).

- Defining it as a hash table test using [`sb-ext:define-hash-table-test`][c29a].

### 12.2 Package Lock Dictionary

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ADISABLE-PACKAGE-LOCKS-20DECLARATION-29"></a>

- [declaration] **sb-ext:disable-package-locks**

    Syntax: `(sb-ext:disable-package-locks &rest symbols)`
    
    Disables package locks affecting the named symbols during compilation
    in the lexical scope of the declaration. Disabling locks on symbols
    whose home package is unlocked, or disabling an already disabled lock,
    has no effect.

    Syntax: `(sb-ext:enable-package-locks &rest symbols)`
    
    Re-enables package locks affecting the named symbols during
    compilation in the lexical scope of the declaration. Enabling locks
    that were not first disabled with [`sb-ext:disable-package-locks`][6652]
    declaration, or enabling locks that are already enabled has no effect.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3APACKAGE-LOCK-VIOLATION-20CONDITION-29"></a>

    Subtype of [`sb-ext:package-lock-violation`][5685]. An error of this type is
    signalled when an operation on a symbol violates a package lock. The
    symbol that caused the violation is accessed by the function
    [`sb-ext:package-locked-error-symbol`][0b58].

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3APACKAGE-LOCKED-ERROR-SYMBOL-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:package-locked-error-symbol** *condition*

    Return the symbol that caused the [`symbol-package-locked-error`][c892]
    condition.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3APACKAGE-LOCKED-P-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:package-locked-p** *package*

    Returns `t` when `package` is locked, `nil` otherwise. Signals an error
    if `package` doesn't designate a valid package.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ALOCK-PACKAGE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:lock-package** *package*

    Locks `package` and returns `t`. Has no effect if `package` was already
    locked. Signals an error if `package` is not a valid package designator

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AUNLOCK-PACKAGE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:unlock-package** *package*

    Unlocks `package` and returns `t`. Has no effect if `package` was already
    unlocked. Signals an error if `package` is not a valid package designator.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3APACKAGE-IMPLEMENTED-BY-LIST-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:package-implemented-by-list** *package*

    Returns a list containing the implementation packages of
    `package`. Signals an error if `package` is not a valid package designator.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3APACKAGE-IMPLEMENTS-LIST-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:package-implements-list** *package*

    Returns the packages that `package` is an implementation package
    of. Signals an error if `package` is not a valid package designator.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AADD-IMPLEMENTATION-PACKAGE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:add-implementation-package** *packages-to-add &optional (package \*package\*)*

    Adds `packages-to-add` as implementation packages of `package`. Signals
    an error if `package` or any of the `packages-to-add` is not a valid
    package designator.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AREMOVE-IMPLEMENTATION-PACKAGE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:remove-implementation-package** *packages-to-remove &optional (package \*package\*)*

    Removes `packages-to-remove` from the implementation packages of
    `package`. Signals an error if `package` or any of the `packages-to-remove`
    is not a valid package designator.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AWITHOUT-PACKAGE-LOCKS-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-ext:without-package-locks** *&body body*

    Ignores all runtime package lock violations during the execution of
    body. Body can begin with declarations.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AWITH-UNLOCKED-PACKAGES-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-ext:with-unlocked-packages** *(&rest packages) &body forms*

    Unlocks `packages` for the dynamic scope of the body. Signals an
    error if any of `packages` is not a valid package designator.

The [`defpackage`][9b43] options are extended to include the following:

- `:lock` `<boolean>` (defaults to `nil`)

    If the argument to `:lock` is `t`, the package is locked, else it is
    unlocked. Existing package are also affected.

- `:implement` `<package-designator>*`

    The package is added as an implementation package to the
    packages named. If `:implement` is not provided, it defaults to
    the package itself.

Example:

    (defpackage "FOO" (:export "BAR") (:lock t) (:implement))
    (defpackage "FOO-INT" (:use "FOO") (:implement "FOO" "FOO-INT"))
    
    ;;; is equivalent to
    
    (defpackage "FOO") (:export "BAR"))
    (lock-package "FOO")
    (remove-implementation-package "FOO" "FOO")
    
    (defpackage "FOO-INT" (:use "BAR"))
    (add-implementation-package "FOO-INT" "FOO")


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40THREADING-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

## 13 Threading

SBCL supports a fairly low-level threading interface that maps onto
the host operating system's concept of threads or lightweight
processes. This means that threads may take advantage of hardware
multiprocessing on machines that have more than one CPU, but it does
not allow Lisp control of the scheduler. This is found in the
`sb-thread` package.

Threads are part of the default build on x86\[-64\]/ARM64 Linux and
Windows.

They are also supported on: x86\[-64\] Darwin (Mac OS X), x86\[-64\]
FreeBSD, x86 SunOS (Solaris), PPC Linux, ARM64 Linux, RISC-V Linux.
On these platforms threads must be explicitly enabled at build-time,
see `install` for directions.

#### 13.1.1 Thread Objects

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ATHREAD-20STRUCTURE-29"></a>

- [structure] **sb-thread:thread**

    Thread type. Do not rely on threads being structs as it may change
    in future versions.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3A-2ACURRENT-THREAD-2A-20VARIABLE-29"></a>

- [variable] **sb-thread:\*current-thread\***

    Bound in each thread to the thread itself.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ALIST-ALL-THREADS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:list-all-threads**

    Return a list of the live threads. Note that the return value is
    potentially stale even before the function returns, as new threads may be
    created and old ones may exit at any time.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ATHREAD-ALIVE-P-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:thread-alive-p** *thread*

    Return `t` if `thread` is still alive. Note that the return value is
    potentially stale even before the function returns, as the thread may exit at
    any time.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ATHREAD-NAME-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:thread-name** *thread*

    Name of the thread. Can be assigned to using [`setf`][a138]. A thread name must be
    a simple-string (not necessarily unique) or `nil`.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AMAIN-THREAD-P-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:main-thread-p** *&optional (thread \*current-thread\*)*

    True if `thread`, defaulting to current thread, is the main thread of the process.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AMAIN-THREAD-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:main-thread**

    Returns the main thread of the process.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40RUNNING-THREADS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 13.1.2 Running Threads

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AMAKE-THREAD-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:make-thread** *function &key name arguments*

    Create a new thread of `name` that runs `function` with the argument
    list designator provided (defaults to no argument). Thread exits when
    the function returns. The return values of `function` are kept around
    and can be retrieved by [`join-thread`][bcf9].
    
    Invoking the initial [`abort`][ae44] restart established by `make-thread`
    terminates the thread.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ARETURN-FROM-THREAD-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-thread:return-from-thread** *values-form &key allow-exit*

    Unwinds from and terminates the current thread, with values from
    `values-form` as the results visible to [`join-thread`][bcf9].
    
    If current thread is the main thread of the process (see
    [`main-thread-p`][e8a0]), signals an error unless `allow-exit` is true, as
    terminating the main thread would terminate the entire process. If
    `allow-exit` is true, returning from the main thread is equivalent to
    calling [`sb-ext:exit`][7f27] with `:code` 0 and `:abort` `nil`.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AABORT-THREAD-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:abort-thread** *&key allow-exit*

    Unwinds from and terminates the current thread abnormally, causing
    [`join-thread`][bcf9] on current thread to signal an error unless a
    default-value is provided.
    
    If current thread is the main thread of the process (see
    [`main-thread-p`][e8a0]), signals an error unless `allow-exit` is true, as
    terminating the main thread would terminate the entire process. If
    `allow-exit` is true, aborting the main thread is equivalent to calling
    [`sb-ext:exit`][7f27] code 1 and `:abort` `nil`.
    
    Invoking the initial [`abort`][ae44] restart established by [`make-thread`][1f38] is
    equivalent to calling `abort-thread` in other than main threads.
    However, whereas [`abort`][ae44] restart may be rebound, `abort-thread` always
    unwinds the entire thread. (Behaviour of the initial [`abort`][ae44] restart for
    main thread depends on the `:toplevel` argument to
    [`sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die`][9e55].)

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AJOIN-THREAD-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:join-thread** *thread &key default timeout*

    Suspend current thread until `thread` exits. Return the result values
    of the thread function.
    
    If `thread` does not exit within `timeout` seconds and `default` is
    supplied, return two values: 1) `default` 2) `:timeout`. If `default` is not
    supplied, signal a [`join-thread-error`][b715] with `join-thread-problem` equal
    to `:timeout`.
    
    If `thread` does not exit normally (i.e. aborted) and `default` is
    supplied, return two values: 1) `default` 2) `:abort`. If `default` is not
    supplied, signal a `join-thread-error` with `join-thread-problem` equal
    to `:abort`.
    
    If `thread` is the current thread, signal a `join-thread-error` with
    `join-thread-problem` equal to `:self-join`.
    
    Trying to join the main thread causes `join-thread` to block until
    `timeout` occurs or the process exits: when the main thread exits, the
    entire process exits.
    
    Users should not rely on the ability to join a chosen `thread` from more
    than one other thread simultaneously. Future changes to `join-thread` may
    directly call the underlying thread library, and not all threading
    implementations consider such usage to be well-defined.
    
    > *Note*: Return convention in case of a timeout is experimental and
    > subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ATHREAD-YIELD-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:thread-yield**

    Yield the processor to other threads.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40ASYNCHRONOUS-OPERATIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 13.1.3 Asynchronous Operations

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AINTERRUPT-THREAD-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:interrupt-thread** *thread function*

    Interrupt `thread` and make it run `function`.
    
    The interrupt is asynchronous, and can occur anywhere with the exception of
    sections protected using `sb-sys:without-interrupts`.
    
    `function` is called with interrupts disabled, under
    `sb-sys:allow-with-interrupts`. Since functions such as [`grab-mutex`][ae28] may try to
    enable interrupts internally, in most cases `function` should either enter
    `sb-sys:with-interrupts` to allow nested interrupts, or
    `sb-sys:without-interrupts` to prevent them completely.
    
    When a thread receives multiple interrupts, they are executed in the order
    they were sent -- first in, first out.
    
    This means that a great degree of care is required to use `interrupt-thread`
    safely and sanely in a production environment. The general recommendation is
    to limit uses of `interrupt-thread` for interactive debugging, banning it
    entirely from production environments -- it is simply exceedingly hard to use
    correctly.
    
    With those caveats in mind, what you need to know when using it:
    
    - If calling `function` causes a non-local transfer of control (ie. an
      unwind), all normal cleanup forms will be executed.
    
        However, if the interrupt occurs during cleanup forms of an
        [`unwind-protect`][c93f], it is just as if that had happened due to a
        regular [`go`][f2e5], [`throw`][e760], or [`return-from`][3eef]: the interrupted cleanup form
        and those following it in the same `unwind-protect` do not get
        executed.
    
        SBCL tries to keep its own internals asynch-unwind-safe, but this
        is frankly an unreasonable expectation for third party libraries,
        especially given that asynch-unwind-safety does not compose: a
        function calling only asynch-unwind-safe function isn't
        automatically asynch-unwind-safe.
    
        This means that in order for an asynch unwind to be safe, the
        entire callstack at the point of interruption needs to be
        asynch-unwind-safe.
    
    - In addition to asynch-unwind-safety you must consider the issue of
      reentrancy. `interrupt-thread` can cause function that are never
      normally called recursively to be re-entered during their dynamic
      contour, which may cause them to misbehave. (Consider binding of
      special variables, values of global variables, etc.)
    
    Taken together, these two restrict the "safe" things to do using
    `interrupt-thread` to a fairly minimal set. One useful one -- exclusively for
    interactive development use is using it to force entry to debugger to inspect
    the state of a thread:
    
        (interrupt-thread thread #'break)
    
    Short version: be careful out there.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ATERMINATE-THREAD-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:terminate-thread** *thread*

    Terminate the thread identified by `thread`, by interrupting it and
    causing it to call [`sb-thread:abort-thread`][1d60] with `:allow-exit` `t`.
    
    The unwind caused by `terminate-thread` is asynchronous, meaning that
    eg. thread executing
    
        (let (foo)
           (unwind-protect
               (progn
                  (setf foo (get-foo))
                  (work-on-foo foo))
             (when foo
               ;; An interrupt occurring inside the cleanup clause
               ;; will cause cleanups from the current UNWIND-PROTECT
               ;; to be dropped.
               (release-foo foo))))
    
    might miss calling `release-foo` despite GET-FOO having returned true
    if the interrupt occurs inside the cleanup clause, eg. during
    execution of `release-foo`.
    
    Thus, in order to write an asynch unwind safe [`unwind-protect`][c93f] you need
    to use `without-interrupts`:
    
        (let (foo)
          (sb-sys:without-interrupts
            (unwind-protect
                (progn
                  (setf foo (sb-sys:allow-with-interrupts
                              (get-foo)))
                  (sb-sys:with-local-interrupts
                    (work-on-foo foo)))
             (when foo
               (release-foo foo)))))
    
    Since most libraries using `unwind-protect` do not do this, you should never
    assume that unknown code can safely be terminated using `terminate-thread`.

#### 13.1.4 Miscellaneous Operations

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ASYMBOL-VALUE-IN-THREAD-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:symbol-value-in-thread** *symbol thread &optional (errorp t)*

    Return the local value of `symbol` in `thread`, and a secondary value of `t`
    on success.
    
    If the value cannot be retrieved (because the thread has exited or because it
    has no local binding for `name`) and `errorp` is true signals an error of type
    [`symbol-value-in-thread-error`][76d3]; if `errorp` is false returns a primary value of
    `nil`, and a secondary value of `nil`.
    
    Can also be used with [`setf`][a138] to change the thread-local value of `symbol`.
    
    `symbol-value-in-thread` is primarily intended as a debugging tool, and not as a
    mechanism for inter-thread communication.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40ERROR-CONDITIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 13.1.5 Error Conditions

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ATHREAD-ERROR-20CONDITION-29"></a>

- [condition] **sb-thread:thread-error** *[error][d162]*

    Conditions of type [`thread-error`][1286] are signalled when thread operations fail.
    The offending thread is initialized by the `:thread` initialization argument and
    read by the function [`thread-error-thread`][693b].

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ATHREAD-ERROR-THREAD-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:thread-error-thread** *condition*

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ASYMBOL-VALUE-IN-THREAD-ERROR-20CONDITION-29"></a>

- [condition] **sb-thread:symbol-value-in-thread-error** *[cell-error][9ad9] [sb-thread:thread-error][1286]*

    Signalled when [`symbol-value-in-thread`][9bed] or its [`setf`][a138] version fails due to eg.
    the symbol not having a thread-local value, or the target thread having
    exited. The offending symbol can be accessed using [`cell-error-name`][8c8e], and the
    offending thread using [`thread-error-thread`][693b].

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AINTERRUPT-THREAD-ERROR-20CONDITION-29"></a>

- [condition] **sb-thread:interrupt-thread-error** *[sb-thread:thread-error][1286]*

    Signalled when interrupting a thread fails because the thread has already
    exited. The offending thread can be accessed using [`thread-error-thread`][693b].

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AJOIN-THREAD-ERROR-20CONDITION-29"></a>

- [condition] **sb-thread:join-thread-error** *[sb-thread:thread-error][1286]*

    Signalled when joining a thread fails due to abnormal exit of the thread
    to be joined. The offending thread can be accessed using
    [`thread-error-thread`][693b].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SPECIAL-VARIABLES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 13.2 Special Variables

The interaction of special variables with multiple threads is mostly
as one would expect, with behaviour very similar to other
implementations.

- Global special values are visible across all threads.

- Bindings (e.g. using [`let`][4853]) are local to the thread.

- Threads do not inherit dynamic bindings from the parent thread.

The last point means that

    (defparameter *x* 0)
    (let ((*x* 1))
      (sb-thread:make-thread (lambda () (print *x*))))

prints `0` and not `1`.

Note, however, that there is a hard limit on the number of distinct
symbols that can be bound dynamically in threaded builds (see
`--tls-limit` in [Runtime Options][3e4d]). Exceeding this limit triggers
the low-level error `Thread local storage exhausted.`

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40ATOMIC-OPERATIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 13.3 Atomic Operations

Following atomic operations are particularly useful for implementing
lockless algorithms.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AATOMIC-DECF-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-ext:atomic-decf** *place &optional (diff 1)*

    Atomically decrements `place` by `diff`, and returns the value of `place` before
    the decrement.
    
    `place` must access one of the following:
    
    - a [`defstruct`][eac1] slot with declared type `(unsigned-byte 64)` or [`aref`][e22b]
      of a `(simple-array (unsigned-byte 64) (*))` (the type
      `sb-ext:word` can be used for these purposes)
    
    - [`car`][d5a2] or [`cdr`][e012] (respectively [`first`][1db9] or [`rest`][fe9f]) of a [`cons`][229c],
    
    - a variable defined using [`defglobal`][59a9] with a proclaimed type of [`fixnum`][3cde].
    
    Macroexpansion is performed on `place` before expanding `atomic-decf`.
    
    Decrementing is done using modular arithmetic,
    which is well-defined over two different domains:
    
    - For structures and arrays, the operation accepts and produces
       an ([`unsigned-byte`][561a] 64), and `diff` must be of type `(signed-byte
       64)`. `atomic-decf` of `#x0` by one results in `#xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` being stored in
       `place`.
    
    - For other places, the domain is `fixnum`, and `diff` must be a `fixnum`.
       `atomic-decf` of `#x-4000000000000000` by one results in `#x3FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` being stored in
       `place`.
    
    `diff` defaults to 1.
    
    EXPERIMENTAL: Interface subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AATOMIC-INCF-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-ext:atomic-incf** *place &optional (diff 1)*

    Atomically increments `place` by `diff`, and returns the value of `place` before
    the increment.
    
    `place` must access one of the following:
    
    - a [`defstruct`][eac1] slot with declared type ([`unsigned-byte`][561a] 64)
      or [`aref`][e22b] of a ([`simple-array`][451a] (`unsigned-byte` 64) (\*))
      The type `sb-ext:word` can be used for these purposes.
    
    - [`car`][d5a2] or [`cdr`][e012] (respectively [`first`][1db9] or [`rest`][fe9f]) of a [`cons`][229c].
    
    - a variable defined using [`defglobal`][59a9] with a proclaimed type of [`fixnum`][3cde].
      Macroexpansion is performed on `place` before expanding `atomic-incf`.
    
    Incrementing is done using modular arithmetic, which is well-defined
    over two different domains:
    
    - For structures and arrays, the operation accepts and produces
       an (`unsigned-byte` 64), and `diff` must be of type ([`signed-byte`][c474] 64).
       `atomic-incf` of `#xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` by one results in #x0 being stored in `place`.
    
    - For other places, the domain is `fixnum`, and `diff` must be a `fixnum`.
       `atomic-incf` of `#x3FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` by one results in `#x-4000000000000000`
       being stored in `place`.
    
    `diff` defaults to 1.
    
    EXPERIMENTAL: Interface subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AATOMIC-POP-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-ext:atomic-pop** *place*

    Like [`pop`][b6e4], but atomic. `place` may be read multiple times before
    the operation completes -- the write does not occur until such time
    that no other thread modified `place` between the read and the write.
    
    Works on all [`cas`][610a]able places.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AATOMIC-PUSH-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-ext:atomic-push** *obj place*

    Like [`push`][2cb9], but atomic. `place` may be read multiple times before
    the operation completes -- the write does not occur until such time
    that no other thread modified `place` between the read and the write.
    
    Works on all [`cas`][610a]able places.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AATOMIC-UPDATE-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-ext:atomic-update** *place update-fn &rest arguments*

    Updates `place` atomically to the value returned by calling function
    designated by `update-fn` with `arguments` and the previous value of `place`.
    
    `place` may be read and `update-fn` evaluated and called multiple times before the
    update succeeds: atomicity in this context means that the value of `place` did
    not change between the time it was read, and the time it was replaced with the
    computed value.
    
    `place` can be any place supported by [`sb-ext:compare-and-swap`][c1bc].
    
    Examples:
    
        ;;; Conses T to the head of FOO-LIST.
        (defstruct foo list)
        (defvar *foo* (make-foo))
        (atomic-update (foo-list *foo*) #'cons t)
        
        (let ((x (cons :count 0)))
           (mapc #'sb-thread:join-thread
                 (loop repeat 1000
                       collect (sb-thread:make-thread
                                (lambda ()
                                  (loop repeat 1000
                                        do (atomic-update (cdr x) #'1+)
                                           (sleep 0.00001))))))
           ;; Guaranteed to be (:COUNT . 1000000) -- if you replace
           ;; atomic update with (INCF (CDR X)) above, the result becomes
           ;; unpredictable.
           x)

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ACOMPARE-AND-SWAP-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-ext:compare-and-swap** *place old new*

    Atomically stores `new` in `place` if `old` matches the current value of `place`.
    Two values are considered to match if they are [`eq`][5a82]. Returns the previous value
    of `place`: if the returned value is `eq` to `old`, the swap was carried out.
    
    `place` must be an [`cas`][610a]-able place. Built-in `cas`-able places are accessor forms
    whose [`car`][d5a2] is one of the following:
    
    `car`, [`cdr`][e012], [`first`][1db9], [`rest`][fe9f], [`svref`][d64d], [`symbol-plist`][3705], [`symbol-value`][cee6], [`slot-value`][5a85]
     `sb-mop:standard-instance-access`, `sb-mop:funcallable-standard-instance-access`,
    
    or the name of a [`defstruct`][eac1] created accessor for a slot whose storage type
    is not raw. (Refer to the the "Efficiency" chapter of the manual
    for the list of raw slot types.  Future extensions to this macro may allow
    it to work on some raw slot types.)
    
    In case of `slot-value`, if the slot is unbound, [`slot-unbound`][c31a] is called unless
    `old` is `eq` to `sb-pcl:+slot-unbound+` in which case `sb-pcl:+slot-unbound+` is
    returned and `new` is assigned to the slot. Additionally, the results are
    unspecified if there is an applicable method on either
    `sb-mop:slot-value-using-class`, ([`setf`][a138] `sb-mop:slot-value-using-class`), or
    `sb-mop:slot-boundp-using-class`.
    
    Additionally, the `place` can be a anything for which a `cas`-function has
    been defined.

Our [`sb-ext:compare-and-swap`][c1bc] is user-extensible by defining functions
named `(cas <place>)`, allowing users to add CAS support to new
places.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ACAS-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-ext:cas** *place old new*

    Synonym for [`compare-and-swap`][c1bc].
    
    Additionally [`defun`][f472], [`defgeneric`][c7f7], [`defmethod`][6832], [`flet`][091c], and [`labels`][c2ef] can be also used to
    define `cas`-functions analogously to [`setf`][a138]-functions:
    
        (defvar *foo* nil)
        
        (defun (cas foo) (old new)
          (cas (symbol-value '*foo*) old new))
    
    First argument of a `cas` function is the expected old value, and the second
    argument of is the new value. Note that the system provides no automatic
    atomicity for `cas` functions, nor can it verify that they are atomic: it is up
    to the implementor of a `cas` function to ensure its atomicity.
    
    EXPERIMENTAL: Interface subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AGET-CAS-EXPANSION-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:get-cas-expansion** *place &optional environment*

    Analogous to [`get-setf-expansion`][45c0]. Returns the following six values:
    
    - list of temporary variables
    
    - list of value-forms whose results those variable must be bound
    
    - temporary variable for the old value of `place`
    
    - temporary variable for the new value of `place`
    
    - form using the aforementioned temporaries which performs the
      compare-and-swap operation on `place`
    
    - form using the aforementioned temporaries with which to perform a volatile
      read of `place`
    
    Example:
    
        (get-cas-expansion '(car x))
        ; => (#:CONS871), (X), #:OLD872, #:NEW873,
        ;    (SB-KERNEL:%COMPARE-AND-SWAP-CAR #:CONS871 #:OLD872 :NEW873).
        ;    (CAR #:CONS871)
        
        (defmacro my-atomic-incf (place &optional (delta 1) &environment env)
          (multiple-value-bind (vars vals old new cas-form read-form)
              (get-cas-expansion place env)
           (let ((delta-value (gensym "DELTA")))
             `(let* (,@(mapcar 'list vars vals)
                     (,old ,read-form)
                     (,delta-value ,delta)
                     (,new (+ ,old ,delta-value)))
                (loop until (eq ,old (setf ,old ,cas-form))
                      do (setf ,new (+ ,old ,delta-value)))
                ,new))))

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40MUTEX-SUPPORT-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 13.4 Mutex Support

Mutexes are used for controlling access to a shared resource. One
thread is allowed to hold the mutex, others which attempt to take it
will be made to wait until it's free. Threads are woken in the order
that they go to sleep.

    (defpackage :demo (:use "CL" "SB-THREAD" "SB-EXT"))
    
    (in-package :demo)
    
    (defvar *a-mutex* (make-mutex :name "my lock"))
    
    (defun thread-fn ()
      (format t "Thread ~A running ~%" *current-thread*)
      (with-mutex (*a-mutex*)
        (format t "Thread ~A got the lock~%" *current-thread*)
        (sleep (random 5)))
      (format t "Thread ~A dropped lock, dying now~%" *current-thread*))
    
    (make-thread #'thread-fn)
    (make-thread #'thread-fn)


<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AMUTEX-20STRUCTURE-29"></a>

- [structure] **sb-thread:mutex**

    Mutex type.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AWITH-MUTEX-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-thread:with-mutex** *(mutex &key (wait-p t) timeout value) &body body*

    Acquire `mutex` for the dynamic scope of `body`. If `wait-p` is true (the default),
    and the `mutex` is not immediately available, sleep until it is available.
    
    If `timeout` is given, it specifies a relative timeout, in seconds, on how long
    the system should try to acquire the lock in the contended case.
    
    If the mutex isn't acquired successfully due to either `wait-p` or
    `timeout`, `body` is not executed, and `with-mutex` returns `nil`.
    
    Otherwise body is executed with the mutex held by current thread, and
    `with-mutex` returns the values of `body`.
    
    Historically `with-mutex` also accepted a `value` argument, which when provided
    was used as the new owner of the mutex instead of the current thread. This is
    no longer supported: if `value` is provided, it must be either `nil` or the
    current thread.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AWITH-RECURSIVE-LOCK-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-thread:with-recursive-lock** *(mutex &key (wait-p t) timeout) &body body*

    Acquire `mutex` for the dynamic scope of `body`.
    
    If `wait-p` is true (the default), and the `mutex` is not immediately available or
    held by the current thread, sleep until it is available.
    
    If `timeout` is given, it specifies a relative timeout, in seconds, on how long
    the system should try to acquire the lock in the contended case.
    
    If the mutex isn't acquired successfully due to either `wait-p` or
    `timeout`, `body` is not executed, and `with-recursive-lock` returns `nil`.
    
    Otherwise body is executed with the mutex held by current thread, and
    `with-recursive-lock` returns the values of `body`.
    
    Unlike [`with-mutex`][c3fd], which signals an error on attempt to re-acquire an already
    held mutex, `with-recursive-lock` allows recursive lock attempts to succeed.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AMAKE-MUTEX-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:make-mutex** *&key name*

    Create a [`mutex`][e2a7].

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AMUTEX-NAME-20-28MGL-PAX-3ASTRUCTURE-ACCESSOR-20SB-THREAD-3AMUTEX-29-29"></a>

- [structure-accessor] **sb-thread:mutex-name** *mutex*

    The name of the `mutex`. [`setf`][a138]able.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AMUTEX-OWNER-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:mutex-owner** *mutex*

    Current owner of `mutex`, `nil` if the mutex is free. Naturally,
    this is racy by design (another thread may acquire the mutex after
    this function returns), it is intended for informative purposes. For
    testing whether the current thread is holding a mutex see
    `holding-mutex-p`.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AMUTEX-VALUE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:mutex-value** *mutex*

    Current owner of `mutex`, `nil` if the mutex is free. May return a
    stale value, use [`mutex-owner`][e297] instead.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AGRAB-MUTEX-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:grab-mutex** *mutex &key (waitp t) timeout*

    Acquire `mutex` for the current thread. If `waitp` is true (the default) and
    the mutex is not immediately available, sleep until it is available.
    
    If `timeout` is given, it specifies a relative timeout, in seconds, on how long
    `grab-mutex` should try to acquire the lock in the contended case.
    
    If `grab-mutex` returns `t`, the lock acquisition was successful. In case of `waitp`
    being `nil`, or an expired `timeout`, `grab-mutex` may also return `nil` which denotes
    that `grab-mutex` did -not- acquire the lock.
    
    Notes:
    
    - `grab-mutex` is not interrupt safe. The correct way to call it is:
    
              (without-interrupts
                ...
                (allow-with-interrupts (grab-mutex ...))
                ...)
    
        `without-interrupts` is necessary to avoid an interrupt unwinding the call
        while the mutex is in an inconsistent state while `allow-with-interrupts`
        allows the call to be interrupted from sleep.
    
    - `(grab-mutex <mutex> :timeout 0.0)` differs from
    `(grab-mutex <mutex> :waitp nil)` in that the former may signal a
    [`deadline-timeout`][41a3] if the global deadline was due already on
    entering `grab-mutex`.
    
        The exact interplay of `grab-mutex` and deadlines are reserved to change in
        future versions.
    
    - It is recommended that you use [`with-mutex`][c3fd] instead of calling `grab-mutex`
    directly.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ARELEASE-MUTEX-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:release-mutex** *mutex &key (if-not-owner :punt)*

    Release `mutex` and wake up any other thread waiting for it.
    
    `release-mutex` is not interrupt safe: interrupts should be disabled
    around calls to it.
    
    The `if-not-owner` keyword dictates behavior when the current thread does not own the
    mutex. Do nothing and silently return if `:punt`, signal a [`warning`][bcb6] or [`error`][669b] if `:warn`
    or `:error` respectively, or release the mutex anyway if `:force`.

### 13.5 Semaphores

Semaphores are among other things useful for keeping track of a
countable resource, e.g. messages in a queue, and sleep when the
resource is exhausted.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ASEMAPHORE-20STRUCTURE-29"></a>

- [structure] **sb-thread:semaphore**

    Semaphore type. The fact that a `semaphore` is a [`structure-object`][2038]
    should be considered an implementation detail, and may change in the
    future.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AMAKE-SEMAPHORE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:make-semaphore** *&key name (count 0)*

    Create a semaphore with the supplied `count` and `name`.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ASIGNAL-SEMAPHORE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:signal-semaphore** *semaphore &optional (n 1)*

    Increment the count of `semaphore` by `n`. If there are threads waiting
    on this semaphore, then `n` of them is woken up.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AWAIT-ON-SEMAPHORE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:wait-on-semaphore** *semaphore &key (n 1) timeout notification*

    Decrement the count of `semaphore` by `n` if the count would not be negative.
    
    Else blocks until the semaphore can be decremented. Returns the new count of
    `semaphore` on success.
    
    If `timeout` is given, it is the maximum number of seconds to wait. If the count
    cannot be decremented in that time, returns `nil` without decrementing the
    count.
    
    If `notification` is given, it must be a [`semaphore-notification`][1e45] object whose
    [`semaphore-notification-status`][11dd] is `nil`. If `wait-on-semaphore` succeeds and
    decrements the count, the status is set to `t`.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ATRY-SEMAPHORE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:try-semaphore** *semaphore &optional (n 1) notification*

    Try to decrement the count of `semaphore` by `n`. If the count were to
    become negative, punt and return `nil`, otherwise return the new count of
    `semaphore`.
    
    If `notification` is given it must be a semaphore notification object
    with [`semaphore-notification-status`][11dd] of `nil`. If the count is decremented,
    the status is set to `t`.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ASEMAPHORE-COUNT-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:semaphore-count** *semaphore*

    Returns the current count of `semaphore`.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ASEMAPHORE-NAME-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:semaphore-name** *semaphore*

    The name of the semaphore `instance`. [`setf`][a138]able.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ASEMAPHORE-NOTIFICATION-20STRUCTURE-29"></a>

- [structure] **sb-thread:semaphore-notification**

    Semaphore notification object. Can be passed to [`wait-on-semaphore`][4b11] and
    [`try-semaphore`][01ad] as the `:notification` argument. Consequences are undefined if
    multiple threads are using the same notification object in parallel.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AMAKE-SEMAPHORE-NOTIFICATION-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:make-semaphore-notification**

    Constructor for [`semaphore-notification`][1e45] objects. [`semaphore-notification-status`][11dd]
    is initially `nil`.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ASEMAPHORE-NOTIFICATION-STATUS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:semaphore-notification-status** *semaphore-notification*

    Returns `t` if a [`wait-on-semaphore`][4b11] or [`try-semaphore`][01ad] using
    `semaphore-notification` has succeeded since the notification object was created
    or cleared.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ACLEAR-SEMAPHORE-NOTIFICATION-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:clear-semaphore-notification** *semaphore-notification*

    Resets the `semaphore-notification` object for use with another call to
    [`wait-on-semaphore`][4b11] or [`try-semaphore`][01ad].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40WAITQUEUE-2FCONDITION-VARIABLES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 13.6 Waitqueue/condition variables

These are based on the POSIX condition variable design, hence the
annoyingly CL-conflicting name. For use when you want to check a
condition and sleep until it's true. For example: you have a shared
queue, a writer process checking *queue is empty* and one or more
readers that need to know when *queue is not empty*. It sounds
simple but is astonishingly easy to deadlock if another process runs
when you weren't expecting it to.

There are three components:

- the condition itself (not represented in code)

- the condition variable (a.k.a. waitqueue) which proxies for it

- a lock to hold while testing the condition

Important stuff to be aware of:

- when calling condition-wait, you must hold the mutex.
  condition-wait will drop the mutex while it waits, and obtain it
  again before returning for whatever reason;

- likewise, you must be holding the mutex around calls to
  [`sb-thread:condition-notify`][3c4b];

- a process may return from [`sb-thread:condition-wait`][406a] in several
  circumstances: it is not guaranteed that the underlying condition
  has become true. You must check that the resource is ready for
  whatever you want to do to it.

        (defvar *buffer-queue* (make-waitqueue))
        (defvar *buffer-lock* (make-mutex :name "buffer lock"))
        
        (defvar *buffer* (list nil))
        
        (defun reader ()
          (with-mutex (*buffer-lock*)
            (loop
             (condition-wait *buffer-queue* *buffer-lock*)
             (loop
              (unless *buffer* (return))
              (let ((head (car *buffer*)))
                (setf *buffer* (cdr *buffer*))
                (format t "reader ~A woke, read ~A~%"
                        *current-thread* head))))))
        
        (defun writer ()
          (loop
           (sleep (random 5))
           (with-mutex (*buffer-lock*)
             (let ((el (intern
                        (string (code-char
                                 (+ (char-code #A) (random 26)))))))
               (setf *buffer* (cons el *buffer*)))
             (condition-notify *buffer-queue*))))
        
        (make-thread #'writer)

        (make-thread #'reader)


<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AWAITQUEUE-20STRUCTURE-29"></a>

- [structure] **sb-thread:waitqueue**

    Waitqueue type.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AMAKE-WAITQUEUE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:make-waitqueue** *&key name*

    Create a [`waitqueue`][4be3].

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AWAITQUEUE-NAME-20-28MGL-PAX-3ASTRUCTURE-ACCESSOR-20SB-THREAD-3AWAITQUEUE-29-29"></a>

- [structure-accessor] **sb-thread:waitqueue-name** *waitqueue*

    The name of the waitqueue. [`setf`][a138]able.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ACONDITION-WAIT-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:condition-wait** *queue mutex &key timeout*

    Atomically release `mutex` and start waiting on `queue` until another thread
    wakes us up using either [`condition-notify`][3c4b] or [`condition-broadcast`][bd70] on
    `queue`, at which point we re-acquire `mutex` and return `t`.
    
    Spurious wakeups are possible.
    
    If `timeout` is given, it is the maximum number of seconds to wait,
    including both waiting for the wakeup and the time to re-acquire
    `mutex`. When neither a wakeup nor a re-acquisition occurs within the
    given time, returns `nil` without re-acquiring `mutex`.
    
    If `condition-wait` unwinds, it may do so with or without `mutex` being
    held.
    
    Important: Since `condition-wait` may return without `condition-notify` or
    `condition-broadcast` having occurred, the correct way to write code
    that uses `condition-wait` is to loop around the call, checking the
    associated data:
    
        (defvar *data* nil)
        (defvar *queue* (make-waitqueue))
        (defvar *lock* (make-mutex))
        
        ;; Consumer
        (defun pop-data (&optional timeout)
          (with-mutex (*lock*)
            (loop until *data*
                  do (or (condition-wait *queue* *lock* :timeout timeout)
                         ;; Lock not held, must unwind without touching *data*.
                         (return-from pop-data nil)))
            (pop *data*)))
        
        ;; Producer
        (defun push-data (data)
          (with-mutex (*lock*)
            (push data *data*)
            (condition-notify *queue*)))

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ACONDITION-NOTIFY-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:condition-notify** *queue &optional (n 1)*

    Notify `n` threads waiting on `queue`.
    
    IMPORTANT: The same mutex that is used in the corresponding [`condition-wait`][406a]
    must be held by this thread during this call.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ACONDITION-BROADCAST-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:condition-broadcast** *queue*

    Notify all threads waiting on `queue`.
    
    IMPORTANT: The same mutex that is used in the corresponding [`condition-wait`][406a]
    must be held by this thread during this call.

### 13.7 Barriers

These are based on the Linux kernel barrier design, which is in turn
based on the Alpha CPU memory model. They are presently implemented for
x86, x86-64, PPC, ARM64, and RISC-V systems, and behave as compiler
barriers on all other CPUs.

In addition to explicit use of the [`sb-thread:barrier`][4f58] macro, the
following functions and macros also serve as `:memory` barriers:

- [`sb-ext:atomic-decf`][09ac], [`sb-ext:atomic-incf`][deca], [`sb-ext:atomic-push`][6389],
  and [`sb-ext:atomic-pop`][1287]

- [`sb-ext:compare-and-swap`][c1bc]

- [`sb-thread:grab-mutex`][ae28], [`sb-thread:release-mutex`][71b3],
  [`sb-thread:with-mutex`][c3fd] and [`sb-thread:with-recursive-lock`][6d68]

- [`sb-thread:signal-semaphore`][0dce], [`sb-thread:try-semaphore`][01ad] and
  [`sb-thread:wait-on-semaphore`][4b11]

- [`sb-thread:condition-wait`][406a], [`sb-thread:condition-notify`][3c4b] and
  [`sb-thread:condition-broadcast`][bd70].


<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ABARRIER-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-thread:barrier** *(kind) &body forms*

    Insert a barrier in the code stream, preventing some sort of
    reordering.
    
    `kind` should be one of:
    
    - `:compiler`: Prevent the compiler from reordering memory access across
      the barrier.
    
    - `:memory`: Prevent the CPU from reordering any memory access across
      the barrier.
    
    - `:read`: Prevent the CPU from reordering any read access across the
      barrier.
    
    - `:write`: Prevent the cpu from reordering any write access across the
      barrier.
    
    - `:data-dependency`: Prevent the cpu from reordering dependent memory
      reads across the barrier (requiring reads before the barrier to
      complete before any reads after the barrier that depend on them).
      This is a weaker form of the `:read` barrier.
    
    `forms` is an implicit [`progn`][0cc3], evaluated before the barrier. `barrier`
    returns the values of the last form in `forms`.
    
    The file `memory-barriers.txt` in the Linux kernel documentation is
    highly recommended reading for anyone programming at this level.

### 13.8 Sessions/Debugging

If the user has multiple views onto the same Lisp image (for example,
using multiple terminals, or a windowing system, or network access)
they are typically set up as multiple *sessions* such that each view
has its own collection of foreground, background, and stopped
threads. A thread which wishes to create a new session can use
[`sb-thread:with-new-session`][556e] to remove itself from the current
session (which it shares with its parent and siblings) and create a
fresh one.

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AWITH-NEW-SESSION-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-thread:with-new-session** *args &body forms*

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AMAKE-LISTENER-THREAD-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:make-listener-thread** *tty-name*

Within a single session, threads arbitrate between themselves for
the user's attention. A thread may be in one of three notional
states: foreground, background, or stopped. When a background
process attempts to print a repl prompt or to enter the debugger, it
will stop and print a message saying that it has stopped. The user
at his leisure may switch to that thread to find out what it needs.
If a background thread enters the debugger, selecting any restart
will put it back into the background before it resumes. Arbitration
for the input stream is managed by calls to
[`sb-thread:get-foreground`][3646] (which may block) and
[`sb-thread:release-foreground`][929c].

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3AGET-FOREGROUND-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:get-foreground**

<a id="x-28SB-THREAD-3ARELEASE-FOREGROUND-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-thread:release-foreground** *&optional next*

    Background this thread.  If `next` is supplied, arrange for it to
    have the foreground next.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40FOREIGN-THREADS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 13.9 Foreign threads

Direct calls to `pthread_create(3)` (instead of [`sb-thread:make-thread`][1f38])
create threads that SBCL is not aware of, these are called foreign
threads. Currently, it is not possible to run Lisp code in such
threads. This means that the Lisp side signal handlers cannot work.
The best solution is to start foreign threads with signals blocked,
but since third party libraries may create threads, it is not always
feasible to do so. As a workaround, upon receiving a signal in a
foreign thread, SBCL changes the thread's sigmask to block all
signals that it wants to handle and resends the signal to the
current process which should land in a thread that does not block
it, that is, a Lisp thread.

The resignalling trick cannot work for synchronously triggered signals
(`sigsegv` and co), take care not to trigger any. Resignalling for
synchronously triggered signals in foreign threads is subject to
`--lose-on-corruption`, see [Runtime Options][3e4d].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40IMPLEMENTATION-ON-LINUX-X86OIDS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 13.10 Implementation on Linux x86oids

Threading is implemented using pthreads and some Linux specific bits
like futexes.

On x86, the per-thread local bindings for special variables is
achieved using the `%fs` segment register to point to a per-thread
storage area. This may cause interesting results if you link to
foreign code that expects threading or creates new threads, and the
thread library in question uses %fs in an incompatible way. On
x86-64 the r12 register has a similar role.

Queues require the `futex(2)` system call to be available: this is
the reason for the NPTL requirement. We test at runtime that this
system call exists.

Garbage collection is done with the existing Conservative
Generational GC. Allocation is done in small (typically 8k) regions:
each thread has its own region so this involves no stopping.
However, when a region fills, a lock must be obtained while another
is allocated, and when a collection is required, all processes are
stopped. This is achieved by sending them signals, which may make
for interesting behaviour if they are interrupted in system calls.
The streams interface is believed to handle the required system call
restarting correctly, but this may be a consideration when making
other blocking calls e.g. from foreign library code.

Large amounts of the SBCL library have not been inspected for
thread-safety.  Some of the obviously unsafe areas have large locks
around them, so compilation and fasl loading, for example, cannot be
parallelized.  Work is ongoing in this area.

A new thread by default is created in the same POSIX process group and
session as the thread it was created by.  This has an impact on
keyboard interrupt handling: pressing your terminal's intr key
(typically `Control-C`) will interrupt all processes in the
foreground process group, including Lisp threads that SBCL considers
to be notionally *background*. This is undesirable, so background
threads are set to ignore the `sigint` signal.

[`sb-thread:make-listener-thread`][7bca] in addition to creating a new Lisp
session makes a new POSIX session, so that pressing `Control-C` in
one window will not interrupt another listener - this has been found
to be embarrassing.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40TIMERS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

## 14 Timers

SBCL supports a system-wide event scheduler implemented on top of
`setitimer(2)` that also works with threads but does not require a
separate scheduler thread.

The following example schedules a timer that writes `Hello, world`
after two seconds.

    (schedule-timer (make-timer (lambda ()
                                  (write-line "Hello, world")
                                  (force-output)))
                    2)

It should be noted that writing timer functions requires special
care, as the dynamic environment in which they run is unpredictable:
dynamic variable bindings, locks held, etc, all depend on whatever
code was running when the timer fired. The following example should
serve as a cautionary tale:

    (defvar *foo* nil)
    
    (defun show-foo ()
      (format t "~&foo=~S~%" *foo*)
      (force-output t))
    
    (defun demo ()
      (schedule-timer (make-timer #'show-foo) 0.5)
      (schedule-timer (make-timer #'show-foo) 1.5)
      (let ((*foo* t))
        (sleep 1.0))
      (let ((*foo* :surprise!))
        (sleep 2.0)))


<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ATIMER-20STRUCTURE-29"></a>

- [structure] **sb-ext:timer**

    Timer type. Do not rely on timers being structs as it may change in
    future versions.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AMAKE-TIMER-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:make-timer** *function &key name (thread sb-thread:\*current-thread\*)*

    Create a timer that runs `function` when triggered.
    
    If a `thread` is supplied, `function` is run in that thread. If `thread` is
    `t`, a new thread is created for `function` each time the timer is
    triggered. If `thread` is `nil`, `function` is run in an unspecified thread.
    
    When `thread` is not `t`, [`sb-thread:interrupt-thread`][9867] is used to run
    `function` and the ordering guarantees of `sb-thread:interrupt-thread`
    apply. In that case, `function` runs with interrupts disabled but
    `with-interrupts` is allowed.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ATIMER-NAME-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:timer-name** *timer*

    Return the name of `timer`.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ATIMER-SCHEDULED-P-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:timer-scheduled-p** *timer &key (delta 0)*

    See if `timer` will still need to be triggered after `delta` seconds
    from now. For timers with a repeat interval it returns true.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ASCHEDULE-TIMER-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:schedule-timer** *timer time &key repeat-interval absolute-p catch-up*

    Schedule `timer` to be triggered at `time`. If `absolute-p` then `time` is
    universal time, but non-integral values are also allowed, else `time` is
    measured as the number of seconds from the current time.
    
    If `repeat-interval` is given, `timer` is automatically rescheduled upon
    expiry.
    
    If `repeat-interval` is non-`nil`, the Boolean `catch-up` controls whether
    `timer` will "catch up" by repeatedly calling its function without
    delay in case calls are missed because of a clock discontinuity such
    as a suspend and resume cycle of the computer. The default is `nil`,
    i.e. do not catch up.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AUNSCHEDULE-TIMER-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:unschedule-timer** *timer*

    Cancel `timer`. Once this function returns it is guaranteed that
    `timer` shall not be triggered again and there are no unfinished
    triggers.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ALIST-ALL-TIMERS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-ext:list-all-timers**

    Return a list of all timers in the system.

## 15 Networking

The `sb-bsd-sockets` module provides a thinly disguised BSD
socket API for SBCL. Ideas have been stolen from the BSD socket API
for C and Graham Barr's `IO::Socket` classes for Perl.

Sockets are represented as CLOS objects, and the API naming
conventions attempt to balance between the BSD names and good lisp
style.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SOCKETS-OVERVIEW-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 15.1 Sockets Overview

Most of the functions are modelled on the BSD socket API. BSD sockets
are widely supported, portably (by Unix standards, at least)
available on a variety of systems, and documented. There are some
differences in approach where we have taken advantage of some of the
more useful features of Common Lisp -- briefly:

- Where the C API would typically return -1 and set `errno`,
  `sb-bsd-sockets` signals an error. All the errors are subclasses
  of [`sb-bsd-sockets:socket-error`][1351] and generally correspond one for
  one with possible `errno` values.

- We use multiple return values in many places where the C API would
  use pass-by-reference values.

- We can often avoid supplying an explicit length argument to
  functions because we already know how long the argument is.

- IP addresses and ports are represented in slightly friendlier
  fashion than "network-endian integers".

### 15.2 General Sockets

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ASOCKET-20CLASS-29"></a>

- [class] **sb-bsd-sockets:socket**

    Common superclass of all sockets, not meant to be
    directly instantiated.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ASOCKET-BIND-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-bsd-sockets:socket-bind** *socket &rest address*

    Bind `socket` to `address`, which may vary according to socket family.
    For the INET family, pass `address` and `port` as two arguments; for local
    address family sockets, pass the filename string. See also `bind(2)`.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ASOCKET-ACCEPT-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-bsd-sockets:socket-accept** *socket*

    Perform the `accept(2)` call, returning a newly-created connected
    socket and the peer address as multiple values

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ASOCKET-CONNECT-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-bsd-sockets:socket-connect** *socket &rest address*

    Perform the `connect(2)` call to connect `socket` to a remote `peer`.
    No useful return value.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ASOCKET-PEERNAME-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-bsd-sockets:socket-peername** *socket*

    Return `socket`'s peer; depending on the address family this may
    return multiple values

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ASOCKET-NAME-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-bsd-sockets:socket-name** *socket*

    Return the address (as vector of bytes) and port that `socket` is
    bound to, as multiple values.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ASOCKET-RECEIVE-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-bsd-sockets:socket-receive** *socket buffer length &key oob peek waitall dontwait element-type*

    Read `length` octets from `socket` into `buffer` (or a freshly-consed
    buffer if `nil`), using `recvfrom(2)`. If `length` is `nil`, the length of
    `buffer` is used, so at least one of these two arguments must be
    non-`nil`. If `buffer` is supplied, it had better be of an element type
    one octet wide. Returns the buffer, its length, and the address of the
    peer that sent it, as multiple values. On datagram sockets, sets
    `MSG_TRUNC` so that the actual packet length is returned even if
    the buffer was too small.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ASOCKET-SEND-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-bsd-sockets:socket-send** *socket buffer length &key address external-format oob eor dontroute dontwait nosignal confirm more*

    Send `length` octets from `buffer` into `socket`, using `sendto(2)`. If
    `buffer` is a string, it will converted to octets according to
    `external-format`. If `length` is `nil`, the length of the octet buffer is
    used. The format of `address` depends on the socket type (for example
    for INET domain sockets it would be a list of an IP address and a
    port). If no socket address is provided, `send(2)` will be called
    instead. Returns the number of octets written.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ASOCKET-LISTEN-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-bsd-sockets:socket-listen** *socket backlog*

    Mark `socket` as willing to accept incoming connections.  The
    integer `backlog` defines the maximum length that the queue of pending
    connections may grow to before new connection attempts are refused.
    See also `listen(2)`.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ASOCKET-OPEN-P-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-bsd-sockets:socket-open-p** *socket*

    Return true if `socket` is open; otherwise, return false.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ASOCKET-CLOSE-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-bsd-sockets:socket-close** *socket &key abort*

    Close `socket`, unless it was already closed.
    
    If [`socket-make-stream`][d54e] has been called, calls [`close`][848f] using `abort` on that
    stream. Otherwise closes the socket file descriptor using `close(2)`.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ASOCKET-SHUTDOWN-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-bsd-sockets:socket-shutdown** *socket &key direction*

    Indicate that no communication in `direction` will be performed on
    `socket`.
    
    `direction` has to be one of `:input`, `:output` or `:io`.
    
    After a shutdown, no input and/or output of the indicated `direction`
    can be performed on `socket`.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ASOCKET-MAKE-STREAM-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-bsd-sockets:socket-make-stream** *socket &key input output element-type external-format buffering timeout auto-close serve-events*

    Find or create a [`stream`][d5a9] that can be used for IO on `socket` (which
    must be connected).  Specify whether the stream is for `input`, `output`,
    or both (it is an error to specify neither).
    
    `element-type` and `external-format` are as per [`open`][6547].
    
    `timeout` specifies a read timeout for the stream.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ASOCKET-ERROR-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-bsd-sockets:socket-error** *where &optional (errno (socket-errno))*

    Signal an appropriate error for syscall `where` and `errno`.
    
    `where` should be a string naming the failed function.
    
    When supplied, `errno` should be the UNIX error number associated to the
    failed call. The default behavior is to use the current value of the
    errno variable.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ANON-BLOCKING-MODE-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-bsd-sockets:non-blocking-mode** *socket*

    Is `socket` in non-blocking mode?

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SOCKET-OPTIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 15.3 Socket Options

A subset of socket options are supported, using a fairly general
framework which should make it simple to add more as required -- see
`SYS:CONTRIB;SB-BSD-SOCKETS:SOCKOPT.LISP` for details. The name
mapping from C is fairly straightforward: `SO_RCVLOWAT` becomes
`sb-bsd-sockets:sockopt-receive-low-water` and `(setf
sb-bsd-sockets:sockopt-receive-low-water)`.

- [function] **sb-bsd-sockets:sockopt-bsd-compatible** *socket*

    Return the value of the SO-BSDCOMPAT socket option for `socket`. This can also be
    updated with [`setf`][a138]. Available only on Linux.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ASOCKOPT-PASS-CREDENTIALS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-bsd-sockets:sockopt-pass-credentials** *socket*

    Return the value of the SO-PASSCRED socket option for `socket`. This can also be
    updated with [`setf`][a138]. Available only on Linux.

- [function] **sb-bsd-sockets:sockopt-debug** *socket*

    Return the value of the SO-DEBUG socket option for `socket`. This can also be
    updated with [`setf`][a138].

- [function] **sb-bsd-sockets:sockopt-broadcast** *socket*

    Return the value of the SO-BROADCAST socket option for `socket`. This can also be
    updated with [`setf`][a138].

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ASOCKOPT-TCP-NODELAY-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-bsd-sockets:sockopt-tcp-nodelay** *socket*

    Return the value of the TCP-NODELAY socket option for `socket`. This can also be
    updated with [`setf`][a138].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40INET-DOMAIN-SOCKETS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 15.4 INET Domain Sockets

The TCP and UDP sockets that you know and love. Some representation
issues:

- IPv4 Internet addresses are represented by vectors of
  `(unsigned-byte 8)` (e.g. `#(127 0 0 1)`). Ports are just
  integers. No conversion between network- and host-order data is
  needed from the user of this package.

- IPv6 Internet addresses are represented by length 16 vectors of
  `(unsigned-byte 8)` (e.g. `#(0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1)`.
  Ports are just integers. As for IPv4 addresses, no conversion
  between network- and host-order data is needed from the user of
  this package.

- Socket addresses are represented by the two values for address and
  port, so for example, `(sb-bsd-sockets:socket-connect socket #(192
  168 1 1) 80)` for IPv4 and `(sb-bsd-sockets:socket-connect socket
  #(0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1) 80)` for IPv6.


<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3AINET-SOCKET-20CLASS-29"></a>

- [class] **sb-bsd-sockets:inet-socket** *[sb-bsd-sockets:socket][d97f]*

    Class representing TCP and UDP over IPv4 sockets.
    
    Examples:
    
        (make-instance 'sb-bsd-sockets:inet-socket :type :stream :protocol :tcp)
        
        (make-instance 'sb-bsd-sockets:inet-socket :type :datagram :protocol :udp)

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3AINET6-SOCKET-20CLASS-29"></a>

- [class] **sb-bsd-sockets:inet6-socket** *[sb-bsd-sockets:socket][d97f]*

    Class representing TCP and UDP over IPv6 sockets.
    
    Examples:
    
        (make-instance 'sb-bsd-sockets:inet6-socket :type :stream :protocol :tcp)
        
        (make-instance 'sb-bsd-sockets:inet6-socket :type :datagram :protocol :udp)

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3AMAKE-INET-ADDRESS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-bsd-sockets:make-inet-address** *dotted-quads*

    Return a vector of octets given a string `dotted-quads` in the format
    "127.0.0.1". Signals an error if the string is malformed.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3AMAKE-INET6-ADDRESS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-bsd-sockets:make-inet6-address** *colon-separated-integers*

    Return a vector of octets given a string representation of an IPv6
    address `colon-separated-integers`. Signal an error if the string is
    malformed.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3AGET-PROTOCOL-BY-NAME-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-bsd-sockets:get-protocol-by-name** *name*

    Given a protocol name, return the protocol number, the protocol name, and
    a list of protocol aliases.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40LOCAL-DOMAIN-SOCKETS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 15.5 Local Domain Sockets

Local domain (`AF_LOCAL`) sockets are also known as Unix-domain
sockets but were renamed by POSIX presumably on the basis that they
may be available on other systems too.

A local socket address is a string, which is used to create a node
in the local filesystem. This means of course that they cannot be
used across a network.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ALOCAL-SOCKET-20CLASS-29"></a>

- [class] **sb-bsd-sockets:local-socket** *[sb-bsd-sockets:socket][d97f]*

    Class representing local domain (`AF_LOCAL`) sockets,
    also known as Unix-domain sockets.

A local abstract socket address is also a string the scope of which is
the local machine. However, in contrast to a local socket address, there
is no corresponding filesystem node.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3ALOCAL-ABSTRACT-SOCKET-20CLASS-29"></a>

- [class] **sb-bsd-sockets:local-abstract-socket** *[sb-bsd-sockets:local-socket][78dd]*

    Class representing local domain (`AF_LOCAL`) sockets with
    addresses in the abstract namespace.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40NAME-SERVICE-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 15.6 Name Service

Presently name service is implemented by calling out to the
`getaddrinfo(3)` and `gethostinfo(3)`, or to `gethostbyname(3)` and
`gethostbyaddr(3)` on platforms where the preferred functions are
not available. The exact details of the name resolving process (for
example the choice of whether DNS or a hosts file is used for
lookup) are platform dependent.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3AHOST-ENT-20CLASS-29"></a>

- [class] **sb-bsd-sockets:host-ent**

    This class represents the results of an address lookup.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3AGET-HOST-BY-NAME-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-bsd-sockets:get-host-by-name** *host-name*

    Returns a [`host-ent`][1341] instance for `host-name` or signals a `name-service-error`.
    
    Another `host-ent` instance containing zero, one or more IPv6 addresses
    may be returned as a second return value.
    
    `host-name` may also be an IP address in dotted quad notation or some other
    weird stuff - see getaddrinfo(3) for the details.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3AGET-HOST-BY-ADDRESS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-bsd-sockets:get-host-by-address** *address*

    Returns a [`host-ent`][1341] instance for `address`, which should be a vector of
    (integer 0 255) with 4 elements in case of an IPv4 address and 16
    elements in case of an IPv6 address, or signals a `name-service-error`.
    See gethostbyaddr(3) for details.

<a id="x-28SB-BSD-SOCKETS-3AHOST-ENT-ADDRESS-20GENERIC-FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [generic-function] **sb-bsd-sockets:host-ent-address** *host-ent*

    Return some valid address for `host-ent`.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40PROFILING-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

## 16 Profiling

SBCL includes both a deterministic profiler, that can collect
statistics on individual functions, and a more "modern",
statistical profiler.

Inlined functions do not appear in the results reported by either.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DETERMINISTIC-PROFILER-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 16.1 Deterministic Profiler

The package `sb-profile` provides a classic, per-function-call
profiler.

> **Warning**: When profiling code executed by multiple threads in
> parallel, the consing attributed to each function is inaccurate.


<a id="x-28SB-PROFILE-3APROFILE-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-profile:profile** *&rest names*

    If no names are supplied, return the list of profiled functions.
    
    If names are supplied, wrap profiling code around the named functions.
    As in [`trace`][548d], the names are not evaluated. A symbol names a function.
    A string names all the functions named by symbols in the named
    package. If a function is already profiled, then unprofile and
    reprofile (useful to notice function redefinition.)  If a name is
    undefined, then we give a warning and ignore it. See also
    [`unprofile`][738e], [`report`][ac09] and [`reset`][793f].

<a id="x-28SB-PROFILE-3AUNPROFILE-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-profile:unprofile** *&rest names*

    Unwrap any profiling code around the named functions, or if no names
    are given, unprofile all profiled functions. A symbol names
    a function. A string names all the functions named by symbols in the
    named package. `names` defaults to the list of names of all currently
    profiled functions.

<a id="x-28SB-PROFILE-3AREPORT-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-profile:report** *&key limit (print-no-call-list t)*

    Report results from profiling. The results are approximately
    adjusted for profiling overhead. The compensation may be rather
    inaccurate when bignums are involved in runtime calculation, as in a
    very-long-running Lisp process.
    
    If `limit` is set to an integer, only the top `limit` results are
    reported. If `print-no-call-list` is `t` (the default) then a list of
    uncalled profiled functions are listed.

<a id="x-28SB-PROFILE-3ARESET-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-profile:reset**

    Reset the counters for all profiled functions.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40STATISTICAL-PROFILER-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 16.2 Statistical Profiler

The `sb-sprof` module, loadable by

    (require :sb-sprof)

provides an alternate profiler which works by taking samples of the
program execution at regular intervals, instead of instrumenting
functions as [`sb-profile:profile`][07b0] does. You might find `sb-sprof` more
useful than the deterministic profiler when profiling functions in the
`common-lisp` package, SBCL internals, or code where the instrumenting
overhead is excessive.

Additionally `sb-sprof` includes a limited deterministic profiler
which can be used for reporting the amounts of calls to some functions
during

**Example usage:**

    (in-package :cl-user)
    
    (require :sb-sprof)
    
    (declaim (optimize speed))
    
    (defun cpu-test-inner (a i)
      (logxor a
              (* i 5)
              (+ a i)))
    
    (defun cpu-test (n)
      (let ((a 0))
        (dotimes (i (expt 2 n) a)
          (setf a (cpu-test-inner a i)))))
    
    ;;;; CPU profiling
    
    ;;; Take up to 1000 samples of running (CPU-TEST 26), and give a flat
    ;;; table report at the end. Profiling will end one the body has been
    ;;; evaluated once, whether or not 1000 samples have been taken.
    (sb-sprof:with-profiling (:max-samples 1000
                              :report :flat
                              :loop nil)
      (cpu-test 26))
    
    ;;; Record call counts for functions defined on symbols in the CL-USER
    ;;; package.
    (sb-sprof:profile-call-counts "CL-USER")
    
    ;;; Take 1000 samples of running (CPU-TEST 24), and give a flat
    ;;; table report at the end. The body will be re-evaluated in a loop
    ;;; until 1000 samples have been taken. A sample count will be printed
    ;;; after each iteration.
    (sb-sprof:with-profiling (:max-samples 1000
                              :report :flat
                              :loop t
                              :show-progress t)
      (cpu-test 24))
    
    ;;;; Allocation profiling
    
    (defun foo (&rest args)
      (mapcar (lambda (x) (float x 1d0)) args))
    
    (defun bar (n)
      (declare (fixnum n))
      (apply #'foo (loop repeat n collect n)))
    
    (sb-sprof:with-profiling (:max-samples 10000
                              :mode :alloc
                              :report :flat)
      (bar 1000))

**Output:**

The flat report format will show a table of all functions that the
profiler encountered on the call stack during sampling, ordered by
the number of samples taken while executing that function.

               Self        Total        Cumul
      Nr  Count     %  Count     %  Count     %    Calls  Function
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       1     69  24.4     97  34.3     69  24.4 67108864  CPU-TEST-INNER
       2     64  22.6     64  22.6    133  47.0        -  SB-VM::GENERIC-+
       3     39  13.8    256  90.5    172  60.8        1  CPU-TEST
       4     31  11.0     31  11.0    203  71.7        -  SB-KERNEL:TWO-ARG-XOR

For each function, the table will show three absolute and relative
sample counts. The `Self` column shows samples taken while directly
executing that function. The `Total` column shows samples taken
while executing that function or functions called from it (sampled
to a platform-specific depth). The `Cumul` column shows the sum of
all `Self` columns up to and including that line in the table.

Additionally the `Calls` column will record the amount of calls that
were made to the function during the profiling run. This value will
only be reported for functions that have been explicitly marked for
call counting with [`sb-sprof:profile-call-counts`][fab8].

The profiler also hooks into the disassembler such that instructions
which have been sampled are annotated with their relative frequency
of sampling. This information is not stored across different
sampling runs.

**Platform support**

Allocation profiling is only supported on SBCL builds that use the
generational GC. Tracking of call stacks at a depth of more than
two levels is only supported on x86 and x86-64.

**Macros**

<a id="x-28SB-SPROF-3AWITH-PROFILING-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-sprof:with-profiling** *(&key (sample-interval '\*sample-interval\*) alloc-interval (max-samples '\*max-samples\*) reset (mode '\*sampling-mode\*) loop max-depth show-progress (threads :all) report) &body body*

    Evaluate `body` with statistical profiling turned on. If `loop` is true,
    loop around the `body` until a sufficient number of samples has been collected.
    Returns the values from the last evaluation of `body`.
    
    The following keyword args are recognized:
    
    - `:sample-interval` `<n>`
    
        Take a sample every <n> seconds. Default is [`*sample-interval*`][025a].
    
    - `:mode` `<mode>`
    
        If `:cpu`, run the profiler in CPU profiling mode. If `:alloc`, run
        the profiler in allocation profiling mode. If `:time`, run the
        profiler in wallclock profiling mode.
    
    - `:max-samples` `<max>`
    
        If `:loop` is `nil` (the default), collect no more than `<max>`
        samples. If `:loop` is `t`, repeat evaluating body until `<max>`
        samples are taken. Default is [`*max-samples*`][187d].
    
    - `:report` `<type>`
    
        If specified, call `report` with `:type` `<type>` at the end.
    
    - `:reset` `<bool>`
    
        If true, call `reset` at the beginning.
    
    - `:threads` `<list-form>`
    
        Form that evaluates to the list threads to profile, or `:all` to
        indicate that all threads should be profiled. Defaults to all
        threads.
    
        `:threads` has no effect on call-counting at the moment.
    
        On some platforms (e.g. Darwin) the signals used by the profiler
        are not properly delivered to threads in proportion to their CPU
        usage when doing `:cpu` profiling. If you see empty call graphs, or
        are obviously missing several samples from certain threads, you
        may be falling afoul of this. In this case using `:mode` `:time` is
        likely to work better.
    
    - `:loop` `<bool>`
    
        If false (the default), evaluate `body` only once. If true
        repeatedly evaluate `body`.

- [function] **sb-sprof:map-traces** *function samples*

    Call `function` on each trace in `samples`
    
    The signature of `function` must be compatible with (thread trace).
    
    `function` is called once for each trace where `thread` is the
    [`sb-thread:thread`][5ef5] instance that was sampled to produce [`trace`][548d], and `trace`
    is an opaque object to be passed to `map-trace-pc-locs`.
    
    EXPERIMENTAL: Interface subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-SPROF-3ASAMPLE-PC-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-sprof:sample-pc** *info pc-or-offset*

    Extract and return program counter from `info` and `pc-or-offset`.

    Report statistical profiling results.  The following keyword
       args are recognized:
    
    - `:type` `<type>`
    
        Specifies the type of report to generate. If `:flat`, show flat
          report, if `:graph` show a call graph and a flat report. If nil,
          don't print out a report.

        Don't show more than `<max>` entries in the flat report.
    
    - `:min-percent` `<min-percent>`
    
        Don't show functions taking less than `<min-percent>` of the
          total time in the flat report.
    
    - `:sort-by` `<column>`
    
        If `:samples`, sort flat report by number of samples taken.
          If `:cumulative-samples`, sort flat report by cumulative number of samples
          taken (shows how much time each function spent on stack.) Default
          is `*report-sort-by*`.
    
    - `:sort-order` `<order>`
    
        If `:descending`, sort flat report in descending order. If `:ascending`,

    - `:show-progress` `<bool>`
    
        If true, print progress messages while generating the call graph.
    
    - `:call-graph` `<graph>`
    
        Print a report from `<graph>` instead of the latest profiling
         results.
    
    Value of this function is a `call-graph` object representing the
    resulting call-graph, or `nil` if there are no samples (e.g. right after
    calling [`reset`][6468].)
    
    Profiling is stopped before the call graph is generated.

### 17.2 sb-concurrency

Additional data structures, synchronization primitives and tools for
concurrent programming. Similiar to Java's `java.util.concurrent`
package.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-CONCURRENCY-QUEUE-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.2.1 Queue

[`sb-concurrency:queue`][cb60] is a lock-free, thread-safe FIFO queue
datatype.

The implementation is based on *An Optimistic Approach to Lock-Free
FIFO Queues* by Edya Ladan-Mozes and Nir Shavit.

Before SBCL 1.0.38, this implementation resided in its own contrib
(see [sb-queue][bb6c]), which is still provided for
backwards-compatibility, but which has since been deprecated.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AQUEUE-20STRUCTURE-29"></a>

- [structure] **sb-concurrency:queue**

    Lock-free thread safe FIFO queue.
    
    Use [`enqueue`][0e78] to add objects to the queue, and [`dequeue`][1efa] to remove them.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3ADEQUEUE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:dequeue** *queue*

    Retrieves the oldest value in `queue` and returns it as the primary value,
    and `t` as secondary value. If the queue is empty, returns `nil` as both primary
    and secondary value.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AENQUEUE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:enqueue** *value queue*

    Adds `value` to the end of `queue`. Returns `value`.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3ALIST-QUEUE-CONTENTS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:list-queue-contents** *queue*

    Returns the contents of `queue` as a list without removing them from the
    `queue`. Mainly useful for manual examination of queue state, as the list may be
    out of date by the time it is returned, and concurrent dequeue operations may
    in the worse case force the queue-traversal to be restarted several times.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AMAKE-QUEUE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:make-queue** *&key name initial-contents*

    Returns a new [`queue`][cb60] with `name` and contents of the `initial-contents`
    sequence enqueued.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AQUEUE-COUNT-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:queue-count** *queue*

    Returns the number of objects in `queue`. Mainly useful for manual
    examination of queue state, and in [`print-object`][3f2e] methods: inefficient as it
    must walk the entire queue.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AQUEUE-EMPTY-P-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:queue-empty-p** *queue*

    Returns `t` if `queue` is empty, `nil` otherwise.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AQUEUE-NAME-20-28MGL-PAX-3ASTRUCTURE-ACCESSOR-20SB-CONCURRENCY-3AQUEUE-29-29"></a>

- [structure-accessor] **sb-concurrency:queue-name** *queue*

    Name of a `queue`. Can be assigned to using [`setf`][a138]. Queue names
    can be arbitrary printable objects, and need not be unique.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AQUEUEP-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:queuep** *object*

    Returns true if argument is a [`queue`][cb60], `nil` otherwise.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-CONCURRENCY-MAILBOX-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.2.2 Mailbox (lock-free)

[`sb-concurrency:mailbox`][96b9] is a lock-free message queue where one or
multiple ends can send messages to one or multiple receivers. The
difference to [Queue][2771] is that the receiving end may
block until a message arrives.

Built on top of the [Queue][2771] implementation.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AMAILBOX-20STRUCTURE-29"></a>

- [structure] **sb-concurrency:mailbox**

    Mailbox aka message queue.
    
    [`send-message`][dccb] adds a message to the mailbox, [`receive-message`][56df] waits till
    a message becomes available, whereas [`receive-message-no-hang`][5598] is a non-blocking
    variant, and [`receive-pending-messages`][6534] empties the entire mailbox in one go.
    
    Messages can be arbitrary objects.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3ALIST-MAILBOX-MESSAGES-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:list-mailbox-messages** *mailbox*

- [function] **sb-concurrency:make-mailbox** *&key name initial-contents*

    Returns a new [`mailbox`][96b9] with messages in `initial-contents` enqueued.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3ARECEIVE-MESSAGE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:receive-message** *mailbox &key timeout*

    Removes the oldest message from `mailbox` and returns it as the primary
    value, and a secondary value of `t`. If `mailbox` is empty waits until a message
    arrives.
    
    If `timeout` is provided, and no message arrives within the specified interval,
    returns primary and secondary value of `nil`.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3ARECEIVE-MESSAGE-NO-HANG-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:receive-message-no-hang** *mailbox*

    The non-blocking variant of [`receive-message`][56df]. Returns two values,
    the message removed from `mailbox`, and a flag specifying whether a
    message could be received.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3ARECEIVE-PENDING-MESSAGES-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:receive-pending-messages** *mailbox &optional n*

    Removes and returns all (or at most `n`) currently pending messages
    from `mailbox`, or returns `nil` if no messages are pending.
    
    > *Note*: Concurrent threads may be snarfing messages during the run
    > of this function, so even `x` and `y` appearing right next to each
    > other in the result does not necessarily mean that `y` was the
    > message sent right after `x`.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3ASEND-MESSAGE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:send-message** *mailbox message*

    Adds a `message` to `mailbox`. Message can be any object.

#### 17.2.3 Gates

[`sb-concurrency:gate`][da1d] is a synchronization object suitable for when
multiple threads must wait for a single event before proceeding.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AGATE-20STRUCTURE-29"></a>

- [structure] **sb-concurrency:gate**

    [`gate`][da1d] type. Gates are synchronization constructs suitable for making
    multiple threads wait for single event before proceeding.
    
    Use [`wait-on-gate`][e0fd1] to wait for a gate to open, [`open-gate`][1dd7] to open one,
    and [`close-gate`][a3be] to close an open gate. [`gate-open-p`][60df] can be used to test
    the state of a gate without blocking.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3ACLOSE-GATE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:close-gate** *gate*

    Closes `gate`. Returns `t` if the gate was previously open, and `nil`
    if the gate was already closed.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AGATE-NAME-20-28MGL-PAX-3ASTRUCTURE-ACCESSOR-20SB-CONCURRENCY-3AGATE-29-29"></a>

- [structure-accessor] **sb-concurrency:gate-name** *gate*

- [function] **sb-concurrency:gatep** *object*

    Returns true if the argument is a [`gate`][da1d].

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AMAKE-GATE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:make-gate** *&key name open*

    Makes a new gate. Gate will be initially open if `open` is true, and closed if `open`
    is `nil` (the default.) `name`, if provided, is the name of the gate, used when printing
    the gate.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AOPEN-GATE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:open-gate** *gate*

    Opens `gate`. Returns `t` if the gate was previously closed, and `nil`
    if the gate was already open.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AWAIT-ON-GATE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:wait-on-gate** *gate &key timeout*

    Waits for `gate` to open, or `timeout` seconds to pass. Returns `t`
    if the gate was opened in time, and `nil` otherwise.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-CONCURRENCY-FRLOCKS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.2.4 Frlocks, aka Fast Read Locks

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AFRLOCK-20STRUCTURE-29"></a>

- [structure] **sb-concurrency:frlock**

    FRlock, aka Fast Read Lock.
    
    Fast Read Locks allow multiple readers and one potential writer to operate in
    parallel while providing for consistency for readers and mutual exclusion for
    writers.
    
    Readers gain entry to protected regions without waiting, but need to retry if
    a writer operated inside the region while they were reading. This makes frlocks
    very efficient when readers are much more common than writers.
    
    FRlocks are *not* suitable when it is not safe at all for readers and writers
    to operate on the same data in parallel: they provide consistency, not
    exclusion between readers and writers. Hence using an frlock to e.g. protect
    an SBCL hash-table is unsafe. If multiple readers operating in parallel with
    a writer would be safe but inconsistent without a lock, frlocks are suitable.
    
    The recommended interface to use is [`frlock-read`][ba6a] and [`frlock-write`][41b7], but those
    needing it can also use a lower-level interface.
    
    Example:
    
        ;; Values returned by FOO are always consistent so that
        ;; the third value is the sum of the two first ones.
        (let ((a 0)
              (b 0)
              (c 0)
              (lk (make-frlock)))
          (defun foo ()
             (frlock-read (lk) a b c))
          (defun bar (x y)
             (frlock-write (lk)
               (setf a x
                     b y
                     c (+ x y)))))

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AFRLOCK-READ-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-concurrency:frlock-read** *(frlock) &body value-forms*

    Evaluates `value-forms` under `frlock` till it obtains a consistent
    set, and returns that as multiple values.

- [macro] **sb-concurrency:frlock-write** *(frlock &key (wait-p t) timeout) &body body*

    Executes `body` while holding `frlock` for writing.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AMAKE-FRLOCK-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:make-frlock** *&key name*

    Returns a new [`frlock`][56e2] with `name`.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AFRLOCK-NAME-20-28MGL-PAX-3ASTRUCTURE-ACCESSOR-20SB-CONCURRENCY-3AFRLOCK-29-29"></a>

- [structure-accessor] **sb-concurrency:frlock-name** *frlock*

    Name of an `frlock`. [`setf`][a138]able.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AFRLOCK-READ-BEGIN-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:frlock-read-begin** *frlock*

    Start a read sequence on `frlock`. Returns a read-token and an epoch to be
    validated later.
    
    Using [`frlock-read`][ba6a] instead is recommended.

<a id="x-28SB-CONCURRENCY-3AFRLOCK-READ-END-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-concurrency:frlock-read-end** *frlock*

    Ends a read sequence on `frlock`. Returns a token and an epoch. If the token
    and epoch are [`eql`][38a2] to the read-token and epoch returned by [`frlock-read-begin`][0a63],
    the values read under the `frlock` are consistent and can be used: if the values
    differ, the values are inconsistent and the read must be restated.
    
    Using [`frlock-read`][ba6a] instead is recommended.
    
    Example:
    
        (multiple-value-bind (t0 e0) (frlock-read-begin *fr*)
          (let ((a (get-a))
                (b (get-b)))

- [function] **sb-concurrency:release-frlock-write-lock** *frlock*

    Releases `frlock` after writing, allowing valid read-tokens to be acquired again.
    Signals an error if the current thread doesn't hold `frlock` for writing. Using [`frlock-write`][41b7]
    instead is recommended.

### 17.3 sb-cover

The `sb-cover` module provides a code coverage tool for SBCL. The
tool has support for expression coverage, and for some branch
coverage. Coverage reports are only generated for code compiled
using [`compile-file`][0b69] with the value of the
`sb-cover:store-coverage-data` optimization quality set to 3.

As of SBCL 1.0.6, `sb-cover` is still experimental, and the
interfaces documented here might change in later versions.

How to use it:

    ;;; Load SB-COVER
    (require :sb-cover)
    
    ;;; Turn on generation of code coverage instrumentation in the compiler
    (declaim (optimize sb-cover:store-coverage-data))
    
    ;;; Load some code, ensuring that it's recompiled with the new optimization
    ;;; policy.
    (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :cl-ppcre-test :force t)
    
    ;;; Run the test suite.
    (cl-ppcre-test:test)
    
    ;;; Produce a coverage report
    (sb-cover:report "/tmp/report/")
    
    ;;; Turn off instrumentation
    (declaim (optimize (sb-cover:store-coverage-data 0)))


<a id="x-28SB-COVER-3AREPORT-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-cover:report** *directory &key ((:form-mode \*source-path-mode\*) :whole) (if-matches 'identity) (external-format :default)*

    Print a code coverage report of all instrumented files into `directory`.
    If `directory` does not exist, it will be created. The main report will be
    printed to the file cover-index.html. The external format of the source
    files can be specified with the `external-format` parameter.
    
    If the keyword argument `:form-mode` has the value `:car`, the annotations
    in the coverage report will be placed on the [`car`][d5a2]s of any cons-forms,
    while if it has the value `:whole` the whole form will be annotated (the
    default). The former mode shows explicitly which forms were
    instrumented, while the latter mode is generally easier to read.
    
    The keyword argument `if-matches` should be a designator for a function
    of one argument, called for the namestring of each file with code
    coverage info. If it returns true, the file's info is included in the
    report, otherwise ignored. The default value is [`cl:identity`][8ae0].

<a id="x-28SB-COVER-3ARESET-COVERAGE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-cover:reset-coverage** *&optional object*

    Reset all coverage data back to the `Not executed` state.

<a id="x-28SB-COVER-3ACLEAR-COVERAGE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-cover:clear-coverage**

    Clear all files from the coverage database. The files will be re-entered
    into the database when the FASL files (produced by compiling
    `store-coverage-data` optimization policy set to 3) are loaded again into the
    image.

<a id="x-28SB-COVER-3ASAVE-COVERAGE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-cover:save-coverage**

    Returns an opaque representation of the current code coverage state.
    The only operation that may be done on the state is passing it to
    [`restore-coverage`][a1c3]. The representation is guaranteed to be readably printable.
    A representation that has been printed and read back will work identically
    in `restore-coverage`.

<a id="x-28SB-COVER-3ASAVE-COVERAGE-IN-FILE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-cover:save-coverage-in-file** *pathname*

    Call [`save-coverage`][0759] and write the results of that operation into the
    file designated by `pathname`.

<a id="x-28SB-COVER-3ARESTORE-COVERAGE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-cover:restore-coverage** *coverage-state*

    Restore the code coverage data back to an earlier state produced by
    [`save-coverage`][0759].

<a id="x-28SB-COVER-3ARESTORE-COVERAGE-FROM-FILE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-cover:restore-coverage-from-file** *pathname*

    [`read`][fe58] the contents of the file designated by `pathname` and pass the
    result to [`restore-coverage`][a1c3].

<a id="x-28SB-COVER-3AMERGE-COVERAGE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-cover:merge-coverage** *coverage-state*

    Merge the code coverage data to include covered code from an earlier
    state produced by [`save-coverage`][0759].

<a id="x-28SB-COVER-3AMERGE-COVERAGE-FROM-FILE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-cover:merge-coverage-from-file** *pathname*

    [`read`][fe58] the contents of the file designated by `pathname` and pass the
    result to [`merge-coverage`][93a1].

### 17.4 sb-grovel

The `sb-grovel` module helps in generation of foreign function
interfaces. It aids in extracting constants' values from the C
compiler and in generating sb-alien structure and union types,
[Defining Foreign Types][7cc7].

The ASDF (<http://www.cliki.net/ASDF>) component type
GROVEL-CONSTANTS-FILE has its `asdf:perform` operation defined to
write out a C source file, compile it, and run it. The output from
this program is Lisp, which is then itself compiled and loaded.

`sb-grovel` is used in a few contributed modules, and it is
currently compatible only to SBCL. However, if you want to use it,
here are a few directions.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40USING-SB-GROVEL-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.4.1 Using sb-grovel in your own ASDF System

- Create a Lisp package for the foreign constants/functions to go
into.

- Make your system depend on the `sb-grovel` system.

- Create a grovel-constants data file -- for an example, see
  `example-constants.lisp` in the `contrib/sb-grovel/` directory in
  the SBCL source distribution.

- Add it as a component in your system. For example:

        (eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute)
          (require :sb-grovel))
        
        (defpackage :example-package.system
                    (:use :cl :asdf :sb-grovel :sb-alien))
        
        (in-package :example-package.system)
        
        (defsystem example-system
            :depends-on (sb-grovel)
            :components
            ((:module "sbcl"
                      :components
                      ((:file "defpackage")
                       (grovel-constants-file "example-constants"
                                              :package :example-package)))))

Make sure to specify the package you chose in step 1.

- Build stuff.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-GROVEL-CONSTANTS-FILE-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.4.2 Contents of a grovel-constants-file

The grovel-constants-file, typically named `constants.lisp`,
comprises lisp expressions describing the foreign things that you
want to grovel for. A `constants.lisp` file contains two sections:

- a list of headers to include in the C program, for example:

        ("sys/types.h" "sys/socket.h" "sys/stat.h" "unistd.h" "sys/un.h"
         "netinet/in.h" "netinet/in_systm.h" "netinet/ip.h" "net/if.h"
         "netdb.h" "errno.h" "netinet/tcp.h" "fcntl.h" "signal.h")

- A list of sb-grovel clauses describing the things you want to
  grovel from the C compiler, for example:

        ((:integer af-local
                   #+(or sunos solaris) "AF_UNIX"
                   #-(or sunos solaris) "AF_LOCAL"
                   "Local to host (pipes and file-domain).")
         (:structure stat ("struct stat"
                           (integer dev "dev_t" "st_dev")
                           (integer atime "time_t" "st_atime")))
         (:function getpid ("getpid" int )))

There are two types of things that sb-grovel can sensibly extract
from the C compiler: constant integers and structure layouts. It is
also possible to define foreign functions in the constants.lisp
file, but these definitions don't use any information from the C
program; they expand directly to [`sb-alien:define-alien-routine`][5da0]
forms.

Here's how to use the grovel clauses:

- `:integer`: constant expressions in C. Used in this form:

         (:integer lisp-variable-name "C expression" &optional doc export)

    `"C expression"` will be typically be the name of a constant,
    but other forms are possible.

- `:enum`:

         (:enum lisp-type-name ((lisp-enumerated-name c-enumerated-name) ...)))

    An `sb-alien:enum` type with name `lisp-type-name` will be
    defined. The symbols are the `lisp-enumerated-name`s, and the
    values are grovelled from the `c-enumerated-name`s.

- `:structure`: alien structure definitions look like this:

         (:structure lisp-struct-name ("struct c_structure"
                                       (type-designator lisp-element-name
                                        "c_element_type" "c_element_name"
                                        :distrust-length nil)
                                       ; ...
                                       ))

    `type-designator` is a reference to a type whose size (and type
    constraints) will be groveled for. sb-grovel accepts a form of
    type designator that doesn't quite conform to either lisp nor
    sb-alien's type specifiers. Here's a list of type designators
    that sb-grovel currently accepts:

    - `integer`: a C integral type; sb-grovel will infer the exact
      type from size information extracted from the C program. All
      common C integer types can be grovelled for with this type
      designator, but it is not possible to grovel for bit fields
      yet.

    - `(unsigned n)`: an unsigned integer variable that is `n` bytes
      long. No size information from the C program will be used.

    - `(signed n)`: an signed integer variable that is `n` bytes
      long. No size information from the C program will be used.

    - `c-string`: an array of `char` in the structure. sb-grovel
      will use the array's length from the C program, unless you
      pass it the `:distrust-length` keyword argument with non-`nil`
      value (this might be required for structures such as solaris's
      `struct dirent`).

    - `sb-grovel::c-string-pointer`: a pointer to a C string,
      corresponding to the `sb-alien:c-string` type (see
      [Foreign Type Specifiers][47c0]).

    - `(array alien-type)`: an array of the previously-declared
      `alien-type`. The array's size will be determined from the
      output of the C program and the alien type's size.

    - `(array alien-type n):` an array of the previously-declared
      `alien-type`. The array's size will be assumed as being `n`.

Note that `c-string` and `sb-grovel::c-string-pointer` do not have
the same meaning. If you declare that an element is of type
`c-string`, it will be treated as if the string is a part of the
structure, whereas if you declare that the element is of type
`sb-grovel::c-string-pointer`, a *pointer to a string* will be the
structure member.

- `:function`: alien function definitions are similar to
  `define-alien-routine` definitions, because they expand to such
  forms when the lisp program is loaded. See
  [Foreign Function Calls][f4c5].

        (:function lisp-function-name
                   ("alien_function_name" alien-return-type
                                          (argument alien-type)
                                          (argument2 alien-type)))


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-GROVEL-STRUCTURES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.4.3 Programming with sb-grovel's structure types

Let us assume that you have a grovelled structure definition:

    (:structure mystruct ("struct my_structure"
                          (integer myint "int" "st_int")
                          (c-string mystring "char[]" "st_str")))

What can you do with it? Here's a short interface document:

- Creating and destroying objects:

    - Function `(allocate-mystruct)` allocates an object of type
      `mystruct` and returns a system area pointer to it.

    - Macro `(with-mystruct var ((member init) [...]) &body body)`
      allocates an object of type `mystruct` that is valid in
      `body`. If `body` terminates or performs an non-local exit,
      the object pointed to by `var` will be deallocated.

- Accessing structure members:

    - `(mystruct-myint var)` and `(mystruct-mystring var)` return
      the value of the respective fields in `mystruct`.

    - `(setf (mystruct-myint var) new-val)` and
      `(setf (mystruct-mystring var) new-val)` sets the value of the
      respective structure member to the value of `new-val`. Notice
      that in `(setf (mystruct-mystring var) new-val)`'s case,
      `new-val` is a lisp string.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-GROVEL-TRAPS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.4.4 Traps and Pitfalls

Basically, you can treat functions and data structure definitions that
sb-grovel spits out as if they were alien routines and types. This has
a few implications that might not be immediately obvious (especially
if you have programmed in a previous version of sb-grovel that didn't
use alien types):

- You must take care of grovel-allocated structures yourself. They
  are alien types, so the garbage collector will not collect them
  when you drop the last reference.

- If you use the `with-mystruct` macro, be sure that no references
  to the variable thus allocated leaks out. It will be deallocated
  when the block exits.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-INTROSPECT-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 17.5 sb-introspect

The `sb-introspect` module is about finding definitions, as well
as querying their properties and relationships in the running image.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40FINDING-DEFINITIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.5.1 Finding Definitions

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3ADEFINITION-SOURCE-20STRUCTURE-29"></a>

- [structure] **sb-introspect:definition-source**

    This structure identifies a sexp in a compiled file.
    Despite the name, the source location may not correspond to a
    definition but to e.g. a function call (see [`who-calls`][e7ad]).

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3ADEFINITION-SOURCE-PATHNAME-20-28MGL-PAX-3ASTRUCTURE-ACCESSOR-20SB-INTROSPECT-3ADEFINITION-SOURCE-29-29"></a>

- [structure-accessor] **sb-introspect:definition-source-pathname** *definition-source*

    Pathname of the source file.
    This is `nil` if the source location is not in a compiled file.

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3ADEFINITION-SOURCE-FORM-PATH-20-28MGL-PAX-3ASTRUCTURE-ACCESSOR-20SB-INTROSPECT-3ADEFINITION-SOURCE-29-29"></a>

- [structure-accessor] **sb-introspect:definition-source-form-path** *definition-source*

    List of indices that identify the sexp in the
    file given by [`definition-source-pathname`][2d27]. The first element in the
    list is the index of the top-level form that contains the sexp. If the
    file was compiled at a high enough debug level, then the rest of the
    elements recursively index into the list structure of the top-level
    form.
    
    Thus, the form path is somewhat stable regarding edits in the file,
    but it gets invalidated by, for example, inserting a new top-level
    form before the sexp in question.

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3ADEFINITION-SOURCE-FORM-NUMBER-20-28MGL-PAX-3ASTRUCTURE-ACCESSOR-20SB-INTROSPECT-3ADEFINITION-SOURCE-29-29"></a>

- [structure-accessor] **sb-introspect:definition-source-form-number** *definition-source*

    Depth-first index of the sexp within the top-level
    form identified by the first element of [`definition-source-form-path`][c16f].
    That is, this is the index of the sexp in the list of subexpressions
    of the top-level form ordered according to depth-first traversal. 0
    corresponds to the top-level form itself.
    
    When combined with the index of the top-level form (given by the first
    element of `definition-source-form-path`), the form number allows
    reconstruction of the rest of the form path, which may be missing.
    This requires parsing the source file. Currently, this job is
    delegated to e.g. SLIME.

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3ADEFINITION-SOURCE-CHARACTER-OFFSET-20-28MGL-PAX-3ASTRUCTURE-ACCESSOR-20SB-INTROSPECT-3ADEFINITION-SOURCE-29-29"></a>

- [structure-accessor] **sb-introspect:definition-source-character-offset** *definition-source*

    Character offset of the top-level form containing
    the sexp.

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3ADEFINITION-SOURCE-FILE-WRITE-DATE-20-28MGL-PAX-3ASTRUCTURE-ACCESSOR-20SB-INTROSPECT-3ADEFINITION-SOURCE-29-29"></a>

- [structure-accessor] **sb-introspect:definition-source-file-write-date** *definition-source*

    [`file-write-date`][951a] of [`definition-source-pathname`][2d27] at
    the time of compilation. `nil` if not compiled from a file.

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3ADEFINITION-SOURCE-PLIST-20-28MGL-PAX-3ASTRUCTURE-ACCESSOR-20SB-INTROSPECT-3ADEFINITION-SOURCE-29-29"></a>

- [structure-accessor] **sb-introspect:definition-source-plist** *definition-source*

    The `source-plist` from [`with-compilation-unit`][e7bf] in effect
    when the file was compiled.

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3AFIND-DEFINITION-SOURCE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-introspect:find-definition-source** *object*

    Return the [`definition-source`][4f11] corresponding to the definition of `object`
    or `nil` if there is no corresponding definition. `object` must be a
    [`package`][1d5a], [`function`][a51f], [`method`][51c3], [`method-combination`][9b70], `sb-mop:slot-definition`,
    [`standard-object`][a843], [`structure-object`][2038], [`condition`][83e1], [`class`][1f37], [`structure-class`][e608],
    or a subclass of `condition`. An error is signalled for other types.
    
    A `definition-source` object is always returned for definitions that
    exist, but the source location (e.g. [`definition-source-pathname`][2d27]) may
    be missing.
    
    For definitions that do not define an object (e.g. [`defvar`][7334]), use
    [`find-definition-sources-by-name`][f3cc].

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3AFIND-DEFINITION-SOURCES-BY-NAME-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-introspect:find-definition-sources-by-name** *name type*

    Returns a list of [`definition-source`][4f11]s for definitions of `name` with
    the given definition `type`. A `definition-source` object is always
    returned for definitions that exist, but the source location (e.g.
    [`definition-source-pathname`][2d27]) may be missing. `type` can currently be one
    of the following.
    
    - Public definition types:
    
        `:class`
        `:compiler-macro`
        `:condition`
        `:constant`
        `:function`
        `:generic-function`
        `:macro`
        `:method`
        `:method-combination`
        `:package`
        `:setf-expander`
        `:structure`
        `:symbol-macro`
        `:type`
        `:alien-type`
        `:alien-callback`
        `:variable`
        `:declaration`
    
    - Internal definition types:
    
        `:optimizer`
        `:source-transform`
        `:transform`
        `:vop`
        `:ir1-convert`
    
    Definition types are disjoint. For example, `:type` refers to [`deftype`][7f9a]s
    but not [`class`][1f37]es or `sb-alien:define-alien-type`, as those are of
    definition type `:class` and `:alien-type`, respectively. `:function` does
    not include `:generic-function`, `:class` does not include `:structure`,
    etc. `:variable` refers to non-constant dynamic variables (e.g. those
    defined with [`defvar`][7334], [`defparameter`][570e], [`sb-ext:defglobal`][59a9] or
    [`sb-alien:define-alien-variable`][3ac6] but not with [`defconstant`][8934]).
    
    Valid `name`s are generally [`symbol`][e5af]s with the following exceptions:
    
    - For `:compiler-macro`, `:function`, `:generic-function` and `:method`,
      anything that's [`valid-function-name-p`][96b0] is valid.
    
    - For `:package`, string designators are valid.
    
    If an unsupported `type` is requested or `name` is invalid, this function
    returns `nil`.

#### 17.5.3 Functions

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3AFUNCTION-LAMBDA-LIST-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-introspect:function-lambda-list** *function*

    Return the lambda list of `function`.
    `function` must be a function object or a function name in the sense of
    [`valid-function-name-p`][96b0]. Works for special operators, macros, simple
    functions, interpreted functions, and generic functions.
    
    The second return value indicates whether the lambda list could not be
    determined (e.g. because the function was compiled with [`debug`][5df9] 0).

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3AFUNCTION-TYPE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-introspect:function-type** *function-designator*

    Returns the ftype of `function-designator` or `nil`.

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3AMETHOD-COMBINATION-LAMBDA-LIST-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-introspect:method-combination-lambda-list** *method-combination*

    Return the lambda list of the `method-combination` designator.
    `method-combination` can be a method combination object,
    or a method combination name.

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3AVALID-FUNCTION-NAME-P-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-introspect:valid-function-name-p** *name*

    See if `name` is a valid function name. In addition to the ANSI
    definition of function name, which is symbols plus lists like ([`setf`][a138]
    [`symbol`][e5af]), SBCL allows ([`sb-ext:cas`][610a] `symbol`) and various internal
    constructs.

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3AFIND-FUNCTION-CALLERS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-introspect:find-function-callers** *function &optional (spaces '(:all))*

    List functions that call `function` by searching `spaces` for code objects.
    This can make previously garbage objects live.
    
    `spaces` should be a list of the symbols `:dynamic`, `:static`, `:read-only`,
    or `:immobile` on `#+immobile-space`. The shorthand (`:all`) is also
    accepted.

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3AFIND-FUNCTION-CALLEES-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-introspect:find-function-callees** *function*

    Return functions called by `function`.

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3AWHO-CALLS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-introspect:who-calls** *function-name*

    Find the source locations where the global function `function-name` is
    called, and return them as an alist of function or macro name,
    [`definition-source`][4f11] pairs.

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3AWHO-MACROEXPANDS-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-introspect:who-macroexpands** *macro-name*

    Find the source locations where the macro `macro-name` is expanded, and
    return them as an alist of function or macro name, [`definition-source`][4f11]
    pairs.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-INTROSPECT-TYPES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.5.4 Types and Classes

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3ADEFTYPE-LAMBDA-LIST-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-introspect:deftype-lambda-list** *type-specifier-name*

    Returns the lambda list of `type-specifier-name` as the first return
    value, and a flag whether the arglist could be found as the second
    value.
    
    `type-specifier-name` must be a symbol. This function can find the
    lambda list of derived type specifiers (e.g. those defined with
    [`deftype`][7f9a]) and classes with compound type specifier syntaxes (e.g. the
    class [`float`][99b6]). It returns `nil`, `nil` for other type specifiers (e.g. [`and`][94b8],
    [`or`][8808], [`not`][35b8]) and types (e.g. [`list`][9271]).

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3AWHO-SPECIALIZES-DIRECTLY-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-introspect:who-specializes-directly** *class-designator*

    Find the source locations of methods directly specializing on
    `class-designator`, and return them as an alist of generic function
    name, [`definition-source`][4f11] pairs.
    
    A method matches the criterion either if it specializes on the same
    class as `class-designator` designates, or if it eql-specializes on an
    instance of the designated class.
    
    Experimental.

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3AWHO-SPECIALIZES-GENERALLY-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-introspect:who-specializes-generally** *class-designator*

    Find the source locations of methods specializing on
    `class-designator` or a subclass of it, and return them as an alist of
    generic function name, [`definition-source`][4f11] pairs.
    `definition-source-description` identifies the method.
    
    A method matches the criterion either if it specializes on the
    designated class itself or a subclass of it (this includes CLASS-EQ
    specializers), or if it eql-specializes on an instance of the
    designated class or a subclass of it.
    
    Experimental.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-INTROSPECT-ALLOCATION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.5.5 Allocation

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3AALLOCATION-INFORMATION-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-introspect:allocation-information** *object*

    Returns information about the allocation of `object`. The primary return
    value indicates the general type of allocation: `:immediate`, `:heap`,
    `:stack`, or `:foreign`.
    
    Non-NIL secondary return values provide additional information about
    the allocation.
    
    For `:heap` objects the secondary value is a plist:
    
    `:space`
        Indicates the heap segment the object is allocated in.
    
    `:generation`
        The current generation of the object: 0 for nursery, 6 for pseudo-static
        generation loaded from core. (GENCGC and `:space` `:dynamic` only.)
    
    `:large`
        Indicates a "large" object subject to non-copying
        promotion. (GENCGC and `:space` `:dynamic` only.)
    
    `:boxed`
        Indicates that the object is allocated in a boxed region. Unboxed
        allocation is used for e.g. specialized arrays after they have survived one
        collection. (GENCGC and `:space` `:dynamic` only.)
    
    `:pinned`
        Indicates that the page(s) on which the object resides are kept live due
        to conservative references. Note that object may reside on a pinned page
        even if `:pinned` is `nil` if the GC has not had the need to mark the page
        as pinned. (GENCGC and `:space` `:dynamic` only.)
    
    `:write-protected`
        Indicates that the page on which the object starts is write-protected,
        which indicates for `:boxed` objects that it hasn't been written to since
        the last GC of its generation. (GENCGC and `:space` `:dynamic` only.)
    
    `:page`
        The index of the page the object resides on. (GENCGC and `:space` `:dynamic`
        only.)
    
    For `:stack` objects, the secondary value is the thread on whose stack
    the object is allocated.
    
    Expected use-cases include introspection to gain insight into allocation and
    GC behaviour and restricting memoization to heap-allocated arguments.
    
    Experimental: interface subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-INTROSPECT-3AMAP-ROOT-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-introspect:map-root** *function object &key simple (ext t)*

    Call `function` with all non-immediate objects pointed to by `object`.
    Returns `object`.
    
    If `simple` is true (default is `nil`), elides those pointers that are not
    notionally part of certain built-in objects but backpointers to a
    conceptual parent: e.g. elides the pointer from a [`symbol`][e5af] to the
    corresponding [`package`][1d5a].
    
    If `ext` is true (default is `t`), includes some pointers that are not
    actually contained in the object but found in certain well-known
    indirect containers: [`fdefinition`][eea4]s, [`eql`][38a2] specializers, classes, and
    thread-local symbol values in other threads fall into this category.
    
    > *Note*: calling `map-root` with a THREAD does not currently map over
    > conservative roots from the thread registers and interrupt contexts.
    
    Experimental: interface subject to change.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-MANUAL-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 17.6 sb-manual

The `sb-manual` module has the SBCL user manual in forms
mimicking `pax:defsection`:

    (defsection @example (:title "Example")
      "This is an example, but see the real @SB-MANUAL."
      (print function)
      (@subexample section))

The names of the variables holding the documentation are exported
from the `sb-manual` package. Since sections are basically
variables, in Slime, `M-.` on `"@SB-MANUAL"`, `"print"`, or
on `"@subexample"` will take you to the respective definition.
This makes it easy to navigate the documentation. Normal Lisp
definition docstrings and section docstrings reference sections
following the usual convention of uppercasing the name. Docstrings
are in a subset of Markdown and use very little markup in general,
so they are easy to read directly in the source.

The official manual in Info, HTML and PDF formats is generated via
Texinfo generated from these definitions.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40USING-PAX-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.6.1 Using PAX

However, `sb-manual::defsection` is but a dummy implementation of
`pax:defsection` to avoid a hard dependency on PAX.

See the `mgl-pax` `asdf:system` or <https://github.com/melisgl/mgl-pax/>.

When PAX is loaded, the dummy `defsection` definitions are made
real, so that PAX can work with them.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3AUSE-PAX-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **use-pax**

    Ensure that exported variables are `pax:section`s.
    It is an error if the `mgl-pax` library is not loaded.
    
    Calling this function explicitly is rarely necessary because it is
    called automatically:
    
    - when `sb-manual` is loaded, if `pax` is present;
    
    - when `pax:document` (more precisely, `dref:locate`) is called on
      an `sb-manual` section.
    
    The latter feature requires v0.4.12 of `pax`. See the `mgl-pax`
    asdf:system.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40BROWSING-LIVE-WITH-PAX-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.6.2 Browsing Live with PAX

With PAX, you can browse the manual live. The documentation of this
feature is available at
[online](https://melisgl.github.io/mgl-pax-world/pax-manual.html#MGL-PAX:@BROWSING-LIVE-DOCUMENTATION%20MGL-PAX:SECTION).

If you are browsing this manual live right now, here is the
equivalent live link: Browsing Live Documentation.

Notable features:

- Autolinks within the manual: if [`sb-ext:exit`][7f27] is mentioned, then
  it's linked to its documentation. You basically get links to where
  `M-.` would go in the sources.

- Autolinks to the CLHS.

- View the documentation of any Lisp definition or section without
  generating the entire manual.

- Locatives (e.g. the `"[function]"` in `"- [function]
  SB-EXT:EXIT"`) are also links in live browsing: they tell Slime
  to visit the definition.

    For this to work, you need to allow Slime to evaluate Elisp sent
    from SBCL:

        (setq slime-enable-evaluate-in-emacs t)

    and maybe your window manager focus stealing configuration needs
    tweaking as well.

Live browsing can greatly reduce the latency of Edit-Compile-View
Loop, when working on documentation.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40FANCY-DOCUMENTATION-WITH-PAX-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.6.3 Fancy Documentation with PAX

PAX can generate dead documentation, too. In the SBCL sources,
`contrib/sb-manual/make-pax-docs.sh` generates the manual in plain
text, Markdown, PDF, and HTML formats. These differ from those
generated via Texinfo in that they are autolinked (like when
[Browsing Live with PAX][4a74]).

Also, you can generate documentation yourself with e.g.

    (pax:document sb-manual:@sbcl-manual :format :markdown)


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-MD5-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 17.7 sb-md5

The `sb-md5` module implements the RFC1321 MD5 Message Digest
Algorithm.

<a id="x-28SB-MD5-3AMD5SUM-FILE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-md5:md5sum-file** *pathname*

    Calculate the MD5 message-digest of the file specified by `pathname`.

<a id="x-28SB-MD5-3AMD5SUM-SEQUENCE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-md5:md5sum-sequence** *sequence &key (start 0) end*

    Calculate the MD5 message-digest of data in `sequence`, which should
    be a 1d [`simple-array`][451a] with element type ([`unsigned-byte`][561a] 8). On CMU CL
    and SBCL non-simple and non-1d arrays with this element-type are also
    supported.

<a id="x-28SB-MD5-3AMD5SUM-STREAM-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-md5:md5sum-stream** *stream*

    Calculate an MD5 message-digest of the contents of `stream`.  Its
    element-type has to be ([`unsigned-byte`][561a] 8). Use on character streams is
    DEPRECATED, as this will not work correctly on implementations with
    [`char-code-limit`][7dc0] > 256 and ignores character coding issues.

<a id="x-28SB-MD5-3AMD5SUM-STRING-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-md5:md5sum-string** *string &key (external-format :default) (start 0) end*

    Calculate the MD5 message-digest of the binary representation of
    `string` (as octets) in the external format specified by
    `external-format`. The boundaries `start` and `end` refer to character
    positions in the string, not to octets in the resulting binary
    representation.  The permissible external format specifiers are
    determined by the underlying implementation.

The implementation for CMUCL was largely done by Pierre Mai, with help
from members of the `cmucl-help` mailing list. Since CMUCL and SBCL
are similar in many respects, it was not too difficult to extend the
low-level implementation optimizations for CMUCL to SBCL. Following
this, SBCL's compiler was extended to implement efficient
compilation of modular arithmetic ([Modular Arithmetic][1a1b]), which
enabled the implementation to be expressed in portable arithmetical
terms, apart from the use of [sb-rotate-byte][0da4] for bitwise rotation.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-POSIX-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 17.8 sb-posix

Sb-posix is the supported interface for calling out to the operating
system.

> *Note*: The functionality contained in the package `sb-unix` is
> for SBCL internal use only; its contents are likely to change from
> version to version.

The scope of this interface is "operating system calls on a typical
Unixlike platform". This is section 2 of the Unix manual, plus
section 3 calls that are (a) typically found in libc, but (b) not
part of the C standard. For example, we intend to provide support
for `opendir(3)` and `readdir(3)` but not for `printf(3)`. That
said, if your favourite system call is not included yet, you are
encouraged to submit a patch to the SBCL mailing list.

Some facilities are omitted where they offer absolutely no
additional use over some portable function, or would be actively
dangerous to the consistency of Lisp. Not all functions are
available on all platforms.

Sb-posix functions do not implicitly take measures to provide
thread-safety or reentrancy beyond whatever the underlying C library
does, except in cases where doing so is necessary to maintain the
consistency of the Lisp image. For example, the bindings to the user
and group database accessing functions are neither thread-safe nor
reentrant unless the underlying libc happens to make them so (but
see [Extensions to POSIX][6c6d]).

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-POSIX-LISP-NAMES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.8.1 Lisp names for C names

All symbols are in the `sb-posix` package. This package contains a
Lisp function for each supported Unix system call or function, a
variable or constant for each supported Unix constant, an object
type for each supported Unix structure type, and a slot name for
each supported Unix structure member. A symbol name is derived from
the C binding's name, by (a) uppercasing, then (b) removing leading
underscores (`#\_`) then replacing remaining underscore characters
with the hyphen (`#\-`). The requirement to uppercase is so that in
a standard upcasing reader the user may write `sb-posix:creat`
instead of `sb-posix:|creat|` as would otherise be required.

No other changes to "Lispify" symbol names are made, so
`creat` becomes `CREAT`, not `CREATE`.

The user is encouraged not to `(use-package :sb-posix)` but instead
to use the `sb-posix:` prefix on all references, as some of the
symbols symbols contained in the `sb-posix` package have the same
name as CL symbols (e.g. [`open`][6547], [`close`][848f], [`signal`][8f49]). Also, see
[Package-Local Nicknames][24fb].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-POSIX-TYPES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.8.2 Types

Generally, marshalling between Lisp and C data types is done using
SBCL's FFI. See [Foreign Function Interface][4be1].

Some functions accept objects such as filenames or file descriptors.
In the C binding to POSIX, these are represented as strings and
small integers respectively. For the Lisp programmer's convenience
we introduce designators such that CL pathnames or open streams can
be passed to these functions. For example, `sb-posix:rename` accepts
both pathnames and strings as its arguments.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-POSIX-FILE-DESCRIPTORS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

##### File-descriptors

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3AFILE-DESCRIPTOR-20TYPE-29"></a>

- [type] **sb-posix:file-descriptor**

    A [`fixnum`][3cde] designating a native file descriptor.
    
    `sb-sys:make-fd-stream` can be used to construct a [`file-stream`][c241] associated with a
    native file descriptor.
    
    Note that mixing I/O operations on a `file-stream` with operations directly on its
    descriptor may produce unexpected results if the stream is buffered.

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3AFILE-DESCRIPTOR-DESIGNATOR-20TYPE-29"></a>

- [type] **sb-posix:file-descriptor-designator**

    Designator for a [`file-descriptor`][d116]: either a fixnum designating
    itself, or a [`file-stream`][c241] designating the underlying file-descriptor.

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3AFILE-DESCRIPTOR-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-posix:file-descriptor** *file-descriptor*

    Converts [`file-descriptor-designator`][ebf7] into a `file-descriptor`.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-POSIX-FILENAMES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

##### Filenames

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3AFILENAME-20TYPE-29"></a>

- [type] **sb-posix:filename**

    A [`string`][68cc] designating a filename in native namestring syntax.
    
    Note that native namestring syntax is distinct from Lisp namestring syntax:
    
        (pathname "/foo*/bar")
    
    is a wild pathname with a pattern-matching directory component.
    [`sb-ext:parse-native-namestring`][b77b] may be used to construct Lisp pathnames that
    denote POSIX filenames as understood by system calls, and
    [`sb-ext:native-namestring`][6b7c] can be used to coerce them into strings in the native
    namestring syntax.
    
    Note also that POSIX filename syntax does not distinguish the names of files
    from the names of directories: in order to parse the name of a directory in
    POSIX filename syntax into a pathname `my-defaults` for which
    
        (merge-pathnames (make-pathname :name "FOO" :case :common)
                          my-defaults)
    
    returns a pathname that denotes a file in the directory, supply a true
    `:as-directory` argument to `sb-ext:parse-native-namestring`. Likewise, to supply
    the name of a directory to a POSIX function in non-directory syntax, supply a
    true `:as-file` argument to `sb-ext:native-namestring`.

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3AFILENAME-DESIGNATOR-20TYPE-29"></a>

- [type] **sb-posix:filename-designator**

    Designator for a [`filename`][c052]: a [`string`][68cc] designating itself, or a
    designator for a [`pathname`][783a] designating the corresponding native namestring.

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3AFILENAME-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-posix:filename** *filename*

    Converts [`filename-designator`][d3ed] into a `filename`.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-POSIX-FUNCTION-PARAMETERS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.8.3 Function Parameters

The calling convention is modelled after that of CMUCL's `unix`
package: in particular, it's like the C interface except that:

- Length arguments are omitted or optional where the sensible value
  is obvious. For example, `read` would be defined this way:

        (read fd buffer &optional (length (length buffer))) => bytes-read

- Where C simulates "out" parameters using pointers (for instance,
  in `pipe(2)` or `socketpair(2)`), these may be optional or omitted
  in the Lisp interface: if not provided, appropriate objects will
  be allocated and returned (using multiple return values if
  necessary).

- Some functions accept objects such as filenames or file
  descriptors. Wherever these are specified as such in the C
  bindings, the Lisp interface accepts designators for them as
  specified in the [Types][ca58] section above.

- A few functions have been included in sb-posix that do not
  correspond exactly with their C counterparts. These are described
  in [Functions with Idiosyncratic Bindings][8607].


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-POSIX-FUNCTION-RETURN-VALUES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.8.4 Function Return Values

The return value is usually the same as for the C binding, except in
error cases: where the C function is defined as returning some
sentinel value and setting `errno` on error, we instead signal an
error of type `sb-posix:syscall-error`. The actual error
value (`errno`) is stored in this condition and can be accessed with
`sb-posix:syscall-errno`.

We do not automatically translate the returned value into lispy
objects -- for example, `sb-posix:open` returns a small integer, not a
stream. Exception: boolean-returning functions (or, more commonly,
macros) do not return a C integer but instead a Lisp boolean.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-POSIX-LISP-OBJECTS-AND-C-STRUCTURES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.8.5 Lisp Objects and C structures

Sb-posix provides various Lisp object types to stand in for C
structures in the POSIX library. Lisp bindings to C functions that
accept, manipulate, or return C structures accept, manipulate, or
return instances of these Lisp types instead of instances of alien
types.

The names of the Lisp types are chosen according to the general
rules described above. For example Lisp objects of type
[`sb-posix:stat`][2a47] stand in for C structures of type `struct stat`.

Accessors are provided for each standard field in the structure.
These are named `<structure-name>-<field-name>` where the two
components are chosen according to the general name conversion
rules, with the exception that in cases where all fields in a given
structure have a common prefix, that prefix is omitted. For example,
`stat.st_dev` in C becomes `stat-dev` in Lisp.

Because sb-posix might not support all semi-standard or
implementation-dependent members of all structure types on your
system (patches welcome), here is an enumeration of all supported
Lisp objects corresponding to supported POSIX structures, and the
supported slots for those structures.

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3AFLOCK-20CLASS-29"></a>

- [class] **sb-posix:flock**

    Class representing locks used in `fcntl(2)`.

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3APASSWD-20CLASS-29"></a>

- [class] **sb-posix:passwd**

    Instances of this class represent entries in the system's user database.

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3AGROUP-20CLASS-29"></a>

- [class] **sb-posix:group**

    Instances of this class represent entries in the system's group database.

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3ASTAT-20CLASS-29"></a>

- [class] **sb-posix:stat**

    Instances of this class represent POSIX file metadata.

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3ATERMIOS-20CLASS-29"></a>

- [class] **sb-posix:termios**

    Instances of this class represent I/O characteristics of the terminal.

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3ATIMEVAL-20CLASS-29"></a>

#### 17.8.6 Functions with Idiosyncratic Bindings

A few functions in sb-posix don't correspond directly to their C
counterparts.

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3AGETCWD-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-posix:getcwd**

    Returns the process's current working directory as a string.

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3AREADLINK-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-posix:readlink** *pathspec*

    Returns the resolved target of a symbolic link as a string.

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3ASYSLOG-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-posix:syslog** *priority format &rest args*

    Send a message to the syslog facility, with severity level
    `priority`.  The message will be formatted as by `cl:format` (rather
    than C's `printf`) with format string `format` and arguments `args`.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-POSIX-EXTENSIONS-TO-POSIX-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.8.7 Extensions to POSIX

Some of POSIX's standardized operators are not safe to use on their
own, so `sb-posix` exports a few helpers that do not correspond
exactly to functionality present in the POSIX standard.

The user and group database accessing routines are not required to
be thread-safe or reentrant and so can only be used safely if all
clients coordinate around their use. Since it would be logically
impossible for independently developed programs to coordinate,
`sb-posix` exports two iteration macros, [`sb-posix:do-passwds`][0f4f] and
[`sb-posix:do-groups`][0eec], each of which iterates over the respective
database while preventing the keyed accesses (`sb-posix:getpwnam`,
`sb-posix:getpwuid`, `sb-posix:getgrnam`, `sb-posix:getgrgid`) from
running until iteration completes.

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3ADO-PASSWDS-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-posix:do-passwds** *(passwd &optional result) &body body*

    Evaluate `body` with `passwd` bound to successive entries from the passwd
    database, and return `result`. An implicit block named `nil` surrounds
    the form; an implicit [`tagbody`][7fae] surrounds `body`. It is unspecified
    whether `passwd` is assigned, rebound, or destructively modified upon
    each iteration. It is an error to use any operator that accesses the
    `passwd` database during the dynamic extent of `do-passwds`.

<a id="x-28SB-POSIX-3ADO-GROUPS-20MGL-PAX-3AMACRO-29"></a>

- [macro] **sb-posix:do-groups** *(group &optional result) &body body*

    Evaluate `body` with `group` bound to successive entries from the group
    database, and return `result`. An implicit block named `nil` surrounds
    the form; an implicit [`tagbody`][7fae] surrounds `body`. It is unspecified
    whether `group` is assigned, rebound, or destructively modified upon
    each iteration. It is an error to use any operator that accesses the
    `group` database during the dynamic extent of `do-groups`.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-QUEUE-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 17.9 sb-queue

Since SBCL 1.0.38, the `sb-queue` module has been merged into the
`sb-concurrency` module. See [sb-concurrency][f634].

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-ROTATE-BYTE-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 17.10 sb-rotate-byte

The `sb-rotate-byte` module offers an interface to bitwise
rotation, with an efficient implementation for operations which can
be performed directly using the platform's arithmetic routines. It
implements the specification at <http://www.cliki.net/ROTATE-BYTE>.

Bitwise rotation is a component of various cryptographic or hashing
algorithms: MD5, SHA-1, etc.; often these algorithms are specified
on 32-bit rings.

<a id="x-28SB-ROTATE-BYTE-3AROTATE-BYTE-20FUNCTION-29"></a>

- [function] **sb-rotate-byte:rotate-byte** *count bytespec integer*

    Rotates a field of bits within `integer`; specifically, returns an
    integer that contains the bits of `integer` rotated `count` times
    leftwards within the byte specified by `bytespec`, and elsewhere
    contains the bits of `integer`.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SB-SIMD-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 17.11 sb-simd

The `sb-simd` module provides a convenient interface for SIMD
programming in SBCL. It provides one package per SIMD instruction
set, plus functions and macros for querying whether an instruction
set is available and what functions and data types it exports.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DATA-TYPES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.11.1 Data Types

The central data type in sb-simd is the SIMD pack. A SIMD pack
is very similar to a specialized vector, except that its length must
be a particular power of two that depends on its element type and
the underlying hardware. The set of element types that are supported
for SIMD packs is similar to that of SBCL's specialized array
element types, except that there is currently no support for SIMD
packs of complex numbers or characters.

The supported scalar types are `f32`, `f64`, `s<n>`, and `u<n>`,
where `<n>` is either 8, 16, 32, or 64. These scalar types are
abbreviations for the Common Lisp types [`single-float`][31a6], [`double-float`][0d57],
[`signed-byte`][c474], and [`unsigned-byte`][561a], respectively. For each scalar data
type `x`, there exists one or more SIMD data type `x.y` with `y`
elements. For example, in AVX there are two supported SIMD data
types with element type `f64`, namely `f64.2` (128 bit) and
`f64.4` (256 bit).

SIMD packs are regular Common Lisp objects that have a type, a
class, and can be passed as function arguments. The price for this
is that SIMD packs have both a boxed and an unboxed representation.
The unboxed representation of a SIMD pack has zero overhead and fits
into a CPU register but can only be used within a function and when
the compiler can statically determine the SIMD pack's type.
Otherwise, the SIMD pack is boxed, i.e. spilled to the heap together
with its type information. In practice, boxing of SIMD packs can
usually be avoided via inlining, or by loading and storing them to
specialized arrays instead of passing them around as function
arguments.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40CASTS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.11.2 Casts

For each scalar data type `x`, there is a function named `x`
that is equivalent to `(lambda (v) (coerce v 'x))`. For each SIMD
data type `x.y`, there is a function named `x.y` that ensures that
its argument is of type `x.y`, or, if the argument is a number,
calls the cast function of `x` and broadcasts the result.

All functions provided by sb-simd (apart from the casts themselves)
implicitly cast each argument to its expected type. So, to add the
number five to each single float in a SIMD pack `x` of type `f32.8`,
it is sufficient to write `(f32.8+ x 5)`. We don't mention this
implicit conversion explicitly in the following sections, so if any
function description states that an argument must be of type `x.y`,
the argument can actually be of any type that is a suitable argument
of the cast function named `x.y`.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40CONSTRUCTORS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.11.3 Constructors

For each SIMD data type `x.y`, there is a constructor named
`make-x.y` that takes `y` arguments of type `x` and returns a SIMD
pack whose elements are the supplied values.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40UNPACKERS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.11.4 Unpackers

For each SIMD data type `x.y`, there is a function named
`x.y-values` that returns, as `y` multiple values, the elements of
the supplied SIMD pack of type `x.y`.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40REINTERPRET-CASTS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.11.5 Reinterpret Casts

For each SIMD data type `x.y`, there is a function named
`x.y!` that takes any SIMD pack or scalar datum and interprets its
bits as a SIMD pack of type `x.y`. If the supplied datum has more
bits than the resulting value, the excess bits are discarded. If the
supplied datum has less bits than the resulting value, the missing
bits are assumed to be zero.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40ASSOCIATIVES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.11.6 Associatives

For each associative binary function, e.g. `two-arg-x.y-op`, there
is a function `x.y-op` that takes any number of arguments and
combines them with this binary function in a tree-like fashion. If
the binary function has an identity element, it is possible to call
the function with zero arguments, in which case the identity element
is returned. If there is no identity element, the function must
receive at least one argument.

Examples of associative functions are `sb-simd-avx:f32.8+`, for
summing any number of 256 bit packs of single floats, and
`sb-simd-fma:u8.32-max`, for computing the element-wise maximum of
one or more 256 bit packs of 8 bit integers.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40REDUCERS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.11.7 Reducers

For binary functions `two-arg-x.y-op` that are not associative but
have a neutral element, there are functions `x.y-op` that take any
positive number of arguments and return the reduction of all
arguments with the binary function. In the special case of a single
supplied argument, the binary function is invoked on the neutral
element and that argument. Reducers have been introduced to generate
Lisp-style subtraction and division functions.

Examples of reducers are `sb-simd-avx:f32.8/`, for successively
dividing a pack of 32 bit single floats by all further supplied
packs of 32 bit single floats, or `sb-simd-fma:u32.8-` for
subtracting any number of supplied packs of 32 bit unsigned integers
from the first supplied one, except in the case of a single
argument, where `sb-simd-fma:u32.8-` simply negates all values in
the pack.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40ROUNDING-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.11.8 Rounding

For each floating-point SIMD data type `x.y`, there are several
functions that round the values of a supplied SIMD pack to nearby
floating-point values whose fractional digits are all zero. Those
functions are `x.y-round`, `x.y-floor`, `x.y-ceiling`, and
`x.y-truncate`, and they have the same semantics as the one argument
versions of [`cl:round`][36fc], [`cl:floor`][c27f], [`cl:ceiling`][c37a], and [`cl:truncate`][45ae],
respectively.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40COMPARISONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.11.9 Comparisons

For each SIMD data type `x.y`, there exist conversion functions
`x.y<`, `x.y<=`, `x.y>`, `x.y>=`, and `x.y=` that check whether the
supplied arguments are strictly monotonically increasing,
monotonically increasing, strictly monotonically decreasing,
monotonically decreasing, equal, or nowhere equal, respectively. In
contrast to the Common Lisp functions [`<`][c3a0], [`<=`][5710], [`>`][5333], [`>=`][a64e], [`=`][e52f], and
[`/=`][cfbd], the SIMD comparison functions don't return a generalized
boolean but a SIMD pack of unsigned integers with `y` elements.
The bits of each unsigned integer are either all one, if the values
of the arguments at that position satisfy the test, or all zero, if
they don't. We call a SIMD packs of such unsigned integers a mask.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40CONDITIONALS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.11.10 Conditionals

The SIMD paradigm is inherently incompatible with fine-grained control
flow. A piece of code containing an [`if`][02ad] special form cannot be
vectorized in a straightforward way, because doing so would require
as many instruction pointers and processor states as there are
values in the desired SIMD data type. Instead, most SIMD instruction
sets provide an operator for selecting values from one of two
supplied SIMD packs based on a mask. The mask is a SIMD pack with as
many elements as the other two arguments, but whose elements are
unsigned integers whose bits must be either all zeros or all ones.
This selection mechanism can be used to emulate the effect of an `if`
special form, at the price that both operands have to be computed
each time.

In sb-simd, all conditional operations and comparisons emit suitable
mask fields, and there is a `x.y-if` function for each SIMD data
type with element type `x` and number of elements `y` whose first
arguments must be a suitable mask, whose second and third argument
must be objects that can be converted to the SIMD data type `x.y`,
and that returns a value of type `x.y` where each element is from
the second operand if the corresponding mask bits are set, and from
the third operand if the corresponding mask bits are not set.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40LOADS-AND-STORES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.11.11 Loads and Stores

In practice, a SIMD pack `x.y` is usually not constructed by
calling its constructor but by loading `y` consecutive elements from
a specialized array with element type `x`. The functions for doing
so are called `x.y-aref` and `x.y-row-major-aref`, and have similar
semantics as Common Lisp's [`aref`][e22b] and [`row-major-aref`][2053]. In addition to
that, some instruction sets provide the functions
`x.y-non-temporal-aref` and `x.y-non-temporal-row-major-aref`, for
accessing a memory location without loading the referenced values
into the CPU's cache.

For each function `x.y-foo` for loading SIMD packs from an array,
there also exists a corresponding function `(setf x.y-foo)` for
storing a SIMD pack in the specified memory location. An exception
to this rule is that some instruction sets (e.g., SSE) only provide
functions for non-temporal stores but not for the corresponding
non-temporal loads.

One difficulty when treating the data of a Common Lisp array as a
SIMD pack is that some hardware instructions require a particular
alignment of the address being referenced. Luckily, most
architectures provide instructions for unaligned loads and stores
that are, at least on modern CPUs, not slower than their aligned
equivalents. So by default we translate all array references as
unaligned loads and stores. An exception are the instructions for
non-temporal loads and stores, that always require a certain
alignment. We do not handle this case specially, so without special
handling by the user, non-temporal loads and stores will only work
on certain array indices that depend on the actual placement of that
array in memory.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40SPECIALIZED-SCALAR-OPERATIONS-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.11.12 Specialized Scalar Operations

Finally, for each SIMD function `x.y-op` that applies a certain
operation `op` element-wise to the `y` elements of type `x`, there
exists also a functions `x-op` for applying that operation only to a
single element. For example, the SIMD function `f64.4+` has a
corresponding function `f64+` that differs from [`cl:+`][0c83] in that it
only accepts arguments of type double float, and that it adds its
supplied arguments in a fixed order that is the same as the one used
by `f64.4`.

There are good reasons for exporting scalar functions from a SIMD
library, too. The most obvious one is that they obey the same naming
convention and hence make it easier to locate the correct functions.
Another benefit is that the semantics of each scalar operation is
precisely the same as that of the corresponding SIMD function, so
they can be used to write reference implementations for testing. A
final reason is that these scalar functions can be used to simplify
the life of tools for automatic vectorization.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40INSTRUCTION-SET-DISPATCH-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 17.11.13 Instruction Set Dispatch

One challenge that is unique to image-based programming systems such as
Lisp is that a program can run on one machine, be dumped as an image,
and then resumed on another machine.  While nobody expects this feature
to work across machines with different architectures, it is quite likely
that the machine where the image is dumped and the one where execution
is resumed provide different instruction set extensions.

As a practical example, consider a game developer that develops software
on an x86-64 machine with all SIMD extensions up to AVX2, but then dumps
it as an image and ships it to a customer whose machine only supports
SIMD extensions up to SSE2.  Ideally, the image should contain multiple
optimized versions of all crucial functions, and dynamically select the
most appropriate version based on the instruction set extensions that
are actually available.

This kind of run time instruction set dispatch is explicitly
supported by means of the SB-SIMD-INTERNALS:INSTRUCTION-SET-CASE
macro. The code resulting from an invocation of this macro compiles
to an efficient jump table whose index is recomputed on each startup
of the Lisp image.

## 18 Deprecation

In order to support evolution of interfaces in SBCL as well as in user
code, SBCL allows declaring functions, variables and types as
deprecated. Users of deprecated things are notified by means of
warnings while the deprecated thing in question is still available.

This chapter documents the interfaces for being notified when using
deprecated thing and declaring things as deprecated, the deprecation
process used for SBCL interfaces, and lists legacy interfaces in
various stages of deprecation.

*Deprecation* in this context should not be confused with those
things the ANSI Common Lisp standard calls *deprecated*: the
entirety of ANSI CL is supported by SBCL, and none of those
interfaces are subject to censure.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40WHY-DEPRECATE-3F-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 18.1 Why Deprecate?

While generally speaking we try to keep SBCL changes as backwards
compatible as feasible, there are situations when existing interfaces
are deprecated:

- **Broken Interfaces**

    Sometimes it turns out that an interface is sufficiently
    misdesigned that fixing it would be worse than deprecating it
    and replacing it with another.

    This is typically the case when fixing the interface would
    change its semantics in ways that could break user code subtly:
    in such cases we may end up considering the obvious breakage
    caused by deprecation to be preferable.

    Another example are functions or macros whose current signature
    makes them hard or impossible to extend in the future: backwards
    compatible extensions would either make the interface
    intolerably hairy, or are sometimes outright impossible.

- **Internal Interfaces**

    SBCL has several internal interfaces that were never meant to be
    used in user code -- or at least never meant to be used in user
    code unwilling to track changes to SBCL internals.

    Ideally, we'd like to be free to refactor our own internals as
    we please, without even going through the hassle of deprecating
    things. Sometimes, however, it turns out that our internal
    interfaces have several external users who aren't using them
    advisedly, but due to misunderstandings regarding their status
    or stability.

    Consider a deprecated internal interface a reminder for SBCL
    maintainers not to delete the thing just yet, even though it is
    seems unused -- because it has external users.

    When internal interfaces are deprecated we try our best to
    provide supported alternatives.

- **Aesthetics \& Ease of Maintenance**

    Sometimes an interface isn't broken or internal but just
    inconsistent somehow.

    This mostly happens only with historical interfaces inherited
    from CMUCL which often haven't been officially supported in SBCL
    before, or with new extensions to SBCL that haven't been around
    for very long in the first place.

    The alternative would be to keep the suboptimal version around
    forever, possibly alongside an improved version. Sometimes we
    may do just that, but because every line of code comes with a
    maintenance cost, sometimes we opt to deprecate the suboptimal
    version instead: SBCL doesn't have infinite developer resources.

    We also believe that sometimes cleaning out legacy interfaces
    helps keep the whole system more comprehensible to users, and
    makes introspective tools such as [`apropos`][b5f2] more useful.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40THE-DEPRECATION-PIPELINE-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 18.2 The Deprecation Pipeline

SBCL uses a *deprecation pipeline* with multiplestages: as
time time goes by, deprecated things move from earlier stages of
deprecation to later stages before finally being removed. The
intention is making users aware of necessary changes early but
allowing a migration to new interfaces at a reasonable pace.

Deprecation proceeds in three stages, each lasting approximately a
year. In some cases it might move slower or faster, but one year per
stage is what we aim at in general. During each stage warnings (and
errors) of increasing severity are signaled, which note that the
interface is deprecated, and point users towards any replacements
when applicable.

- **Early Deprecation**

    During early deprecation the interface is kept in working
    condition. However, when a thing in this deprecation stage is
    used, an [`sb-ext:early-deprecation-warning`][162d], which is a
    [`style-warning`][2056], is signaled at compile-time.

    The internals may change at this stage: typically because the
    interface is re-implemented on top of its successor. While we
    try to keep things as backwards-compatible as feasible (taking
    maintenance costs into account), sometimes semantics change
    slightly.

    For example, when the spinlock API was deprecated, spinlock
    objects ceased to exist, and the whole spinlock API became a
    synonym for the mutex API -- so code using the spinlock API
    continued working but silently switched to mutexes instead.
    However, if someone relied on

        (typep lock 'spinlock)

    returning `nil` for a mutexes, trouble could ensue.

- **Late Deprecation**

    During late deprecation the interface remains as it was during
    early deprecation, but the compile-time warning is upgraded:
    when a thing in this deprecation stage is used, a
    [`sb-ext:late-deprecation-warning`][3f01], which is a full [`warning`][bcb6], is
    signaled at compile-time.

- **Final Deprecation**

    During final deprecation the symbols still exist. However, when
    a thing in this deprecation stage is used, a
    [`sb-ext:final-deprecation-warning`][606c], which is a full `warning`, is
    signaled at compile-time and an [`error`][669b] is signaled at run-time.

- **After Final Deprecation**

    The interface is deleted entirely.

### 18.3 Deprecation Conditions

[`sb-ext:deprecation-condition`][9cb3] is the superclass of all
deprecation-related warning and error conditions. All common slots and
readers are defined in this condition class.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ADEPRECATION-CONDITION-20CONDITION-29"></a>

- [condition] **sb-ext:deprecation-condition** *sb-int:reference-condition*

    Superclass for deprecation-related error and warning
    conditions.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AEARLY-DEPRECATION-WARNING-20CONDITION-29"></a>

- [condition] **sb-ext:early-deprecation-warning** *[style-warning][2056] [sb-ext:deprecation-condition][9cb3]*

    This warning is signaled when the use of a variable,

    compile-time. The use will work at run-time with no warning or
    error.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ALATE-DEPRECATION-WARNING-20CONDITION-29"></a>

    compile-time. The use will work at run-time with no warning or
    error.

<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3AFINAL-DEPRECATION-WARNING-20CONDITION-29"></a>

- [condition] **sb-ext:final-deprecation-warning** *[warning][bcb6] [sb-ext:deprecation-condition][9cb3]*

    This warning is signaled when the use of a variable,

- [condition] **sb-ext:deprecation-error** *[error][d162] [sb-ext:deprecation-condition][9cb3]*

    This error is signaled at run-time when an attempt is made to use
    a thing that is in `:final` deprecation, i.e. call a function or access
    a variable.

### 18.4 Introspecting Deprecation Information

The deprecation status of functions and variables can be inspected
using the `sb-cltl2:function-information` and
`sb-cltl2:variable-information` functions provided by the `sb-cltl2`
contributed module.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DEPRECATION-DECLARATION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 18.5 Deprecation Declaration

The [`sb-ext:deprecated`][5888] declaration can be used to declare objects
in various namespaces as deprecated.

> *Note*: See the [`namespace`][c8c1] `clhs` glossary entry in the glossary of
> the Common Lisp Hyperspec.)


<a id="x-28SB-EXT-3ADEPRECATED-20DECLARATION-29"></a>

- [declaration] **sb-ext:deprecated**

    Syntax: `(sb-ext:deprecated stage since &rest object-clauses)`
    
    stage ::= {`:early` | `:late` | `:final`}
    
    since ::= {`<version>` | (`<software>` `<version>`)}
    
    object-clause ::= (namespace `<name>` \[`:replacement` `<replacement>`\])
    
    namespace ::= {`cl:variable` | [`cl:function`][a51f] | [`cl:type`][7c9f]}
    
    where the terminal `<name>` is the name of the deprecated thing,
    `<version>` and `<software>` are strings describing the version in
    which the thing has been deprecated and `<replacement>` is a name or a
    list of names designating things that should be used instead of the
    deprecated thing.
    
    Currently the following namespaces are supported:
    
    - `cl:function`: Declare functions, compiler-macros or macros as
      deprecated.
    
        When declaring a function to be in `:final` deprecation, there
        should be no actual definition of the function as the declaration
        emits a stub function that signals a [`sb-ext:deprecation-error`][3e47] at
        run-time when called.
    
    - `cl:variable`: Declare special and global variables, constants
      and symbol-macros as deprecated.
    
        When declaring a variable to be in `:final` deprecation, there
        should be no actual definition of the variable as the declaration
        emits a symbol-macro that signals a `sb-ext:deprecation-error` at
        run-time when accessed.
    
    - `cl:type`: Declare named types (i.e. defined via [`deftype`][7f9a]),
      standard classes, structure classes and condition classes as
      deprecated.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40DEPRECATION-EXAMPLES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

### 18.6 Deprecation Examples

Marking functions as deprecated:

    (defun foo ())
    (defun bar ())
    (declaim (deprecated :early ("my-system" "1.2.3")
                         (function foo :replacement bar)))
    
    ;; Remember: do not define the actual function or variable in case of
    ;; :final deprecation:
    (declaim (deprecated :final ("my-system" "1.2.3")
                         (function fez :replacement whoop)))

Attempting to use the deprecated functions:

    (defun baz ()
      (foo))
    | STYLE-WARNING: The function CL-USER::FOO has been deprecated...
    => BAZ
    (baz)
    => NIL ; no error
    
    (defun danger ()
      (fez))
    | WARNING: The function CL-USER::FEZ has been deprecated...
    => DANGER
    (danger)
    |- ERROR: The function CL-USER::FEZ has been deprecated...

### 18.7 Deprecated Interfaces in SBCL

This sections lists legacy interfaces in various stages of deprecation.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40LIST-OF-DEPRECATED-INTERFACES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 18.7.1 List of Deprecated Interfaces

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40EARLY-DEPRECATION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

##### Early Deprecation

- `sockint::win32-*`

    Deprecated in favor of the corresponding prefix-less functions
    (e.g. `sockint::bind` replaces `sockint::win32-bind`) as of
    1.2.10 in March 2015. Expected to move into late deprecation in
    August 2015.

- `sb-unix:unix-exit`

    Deprecated as of 1.0.56.55 in May 2012. Expected to move into
    late deprecation in May 2013.

    When the SBCL process termination was refactored,
    `sb-unix:unix-exit` ceased to be used internally. Since `sb-unix`
    is an internal package not intended for user code to use, and
    since we're slowly in the process of refactoring things to be
    less Unix-oriented, `sb-unix:unix-exit` was initially deleted as
    it was no longer used. Unfortunately it became apparent that it
    was used by several external users, so it was re-instated in
    deprecated form.

    While the cost of keeping `sb-unix:unix-exit` indefinitely is
    trivial, the ability to refactor our internals is important, so
    its deprecation was taken as an opportunity to highlight that
    `sb-unix` is an internal package and `sb-posix` should be used
    by user-programs instead -- or alternatively calling the foreign
    function directly if the desired interface doesn't for some
    reason exist in `sb-posix`.

    **Remedy**

    For code needing to work with legacy SBCLs, use e.g.
    `system-exit`. In modern SBCLs, simply call either `sb-posix:exit`
    or [`sb-ext:exit`][7f27] with appropriate arguments.

- `sb-c::merge-tail-calls` compiler policy

    Deprecated as of 1.0.53.74 in November 2011. Expected to move
    into late deprecation in November 2012.

    This compiler policy was never functional: SBCL has always
    merged tail calls when it could, regardless of this policy
    setting. (It was also never officially supported, but several
    code-bases have historically used it.)

    **Remedy**

    Simply remove the policy declarations. They were never necessary: SBCL
    always merged tail-calls when possible. To disable tail merging,
    structure the code to avoid the tail position instead.

- The Spinlock API

    Deprecated as of 1.0.53.11 in August 2011. Expected to move into
    late deprecation in August 2012.

    Spinlocks were an internal interface but had a number of
    external users and were hence deprecated instead of being simply
    deleted.

    Affected symbols: `sb-thread::spinlock`, `sb-thread::make-spinlock`,
    `sb-thread::with-spinlock`, `sb-thread::with-recursive-spinlock`,
    `sb-thread::get-spinlock`, `sb-thread::release-spinlock`,
    `sb-thread::spinlock-value`, and `sb-thread::spinlock-name`.

    **Remedy**

    Use the mutex API instead, or implement spinlocks suiting your
    needs on top of [`sb-ext:compare-and-swap`][c1bc], `sb-ext:spin-loop-hint`,
    etc.

- `sockint::handle->fd`, `sockint::fd->handle`

    Internally deprecated in 2012. Declared deprecated as of 1.2.10
    in March 2015. Expected to move into final deprecation in August
    2015.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40LATE-DEPRECATION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

##### Late Deprecation

- `sb-thread:join-thread-error-thread` and
  `sb-thread:interrupt-thread-error-thread`

    Deprecated in favor of [`sb-thread:thread-error-thread`][693b] as of
    1.0.29.17 in June 2009. Expected to move into final deprecation
    in June 2012.

    **Remedy**

    For code that needs to support legacy SBCLs, use e.g.:

        (defun get-thread-error-thread (condition)
          #+#.(cl:if (cl:find-symbol "THREAD-ERROR-THREAD" :sb-thread)
                     '(and) '(or))
          (sb-thread:thread-error-thread condition)
          #-#.(cl:if (cl:find-symbol "THREAD-ERROR-THREAD" :sb-thread)
                     '(and) '(or))
          (etypecase condition
           (sb-thread:join-thread-error
            (sb-thread:join-thread-error-thread condition))
           (sb-thread:interrupt-thread-error
            (sb-thread:interrupt-thread-error-thread condition))))

- `sb-introspect:function-arglist`

    Deprecated in favor of [`sb-introspect:function-lambda-list`][b40e] as of
    1.0.24.5 in January 2009. Expected to move into final
    deprecation in January 2012.

    Renamed for consistency and aesthetics. Functions have
    lambda-lists, not arglists.

    **Remedy**

        For code that needs to support legacy SBCLs, use e.g.:
        
        (defun get-function-lambda-list (function)
          #+#.(cl:if (cl:find-symbol "FUNCTION-LAMBDA-LIST" :sb-introspect)
                     '(and) '(or))
          (sb-introspect:function-lambda-list function)
          #-#.(cl:if (cl:find-symbol "FUNCTION-LAMBDA-LIST" :sb-introspect)
                     '(and) '(or))
          (sb-introspect:function-arglist function))

- Stack Allocation Policies

    Deprecated in favor of [`sb-ext:*stack-allocate-dynamic-extent*`][76b5] as
    of 1.0.19.7 in August 2008, and are expected to be removed in
    August 2012.

    Affected symbols: `sb-c::stack-allocate-dynamic-extent`,
    `sb-c::stack-allocate-vector`, and
    `sb-c::stack-allocate-value-cells`.

    These compiler policies were never officially supported, and
    turned out the be a flawed design.

    **Remedy**

    For code that needs stack-allocation in legacy SBCLs,
    conditionalize using:

        #-#.(cl:if (cl:find-symbol "*STACK-ALLOCATE-DYNAMIC-EXTENT*" :sb-ext)
                   '(and) '(or))
        (declare (optimize sb-c::stack-allocate-dynamic-extent))

    However, unless stack allocation is essential, we recommend
    simply removing these declarations. Refer to documentation on
    `sb-ext:*stack-allocate-dynamic*` for details on stack
    allocation control in modern SBCLs.

- `sb-sys:output-raw-bytes`

    Deprecated as of 1.0.8.16 in June 2007. Expected to move into final
    deprecation in June 2012.

    Internal interface with some external users. Never officially
    supported, deemed unnecessary in presence of [`write-sequence`][9ef0] and
    bivalent streams.

    **Remedy**

    Use streams with element-type ([`unsigned-byte`][561a] 8) or
    `:default` -- the latter allowing both binary and character IO --
    in conjunction with `write-sequence`.


<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40FINAL-DEPRECATION-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

##### Final Deprecation

No interfaces are currently in final deprecation.

<a id="x-28SB-MANUAL-3A-40HISTORICAL-INTERFACES-20MGL-PAX-3ASECTION-29"></a>

#### 18.7.2 Historical Interfaces

The following is a partial list of interfaces present in historical
versions of SBCL, which have since then been deleted.

- `sb-kernel:instance-lambda`

    Historically needed for CLOS code. Deprecated as of 0.9.3.32 in
    August 2005. Deleted as of 1.0.47.8 in April 2011. Plain [`lambda`][650d]
    can be used where `sb-kernel:instance-lambda` used to be needed.

- `sb-alien:def-alien-routine`, `sb-alien:def-alien-variable`,
  `sb-alien:def-alien-type`

    Inherited from CMUCL, naming convention not consistent with
    preferred SBCL style. Deprecated as of 0.pre7.90 in December
    2001. Deleted as of 1.0.9.17 in September 2007. Replaced by
    [`sb-alien:define-alien-routine`][5da0], [`sb-alien:define-alien-variable`][3ac6],
    and `sb-alien:define-alien-type`.
