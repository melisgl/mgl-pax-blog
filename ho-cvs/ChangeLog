	* install.sh: use install instead of cp and set executable bits

2004-06-07  Drucker Tamas  <tamas.drucker@essnet.se>

2004-05-29  Gabor Melis  <mega@hotpop.com>

	* merge/remerge: fixed order of -j options (do not depend on cvs

2004-03-29  Gabor Melis  <mega@hotpop.com>

	* hoc-fi-editor: set commit log file modification date to allow
	cvs to detect no modification

2004-03-03  Gabor Melis  <mega@hotpop.com>

	* fixed last fix

2004-02-05  Gabor Melis  <mega@hotpop.com>

	* update does not restore the VERSION file if 'cvs up' fails which
	seems to happen when there is a conflict.

2004-02-04  Gabor Melis  <mega@hotpop.com>

	* added default-map parameter to the add command

2003-08-13  Gabor Melis  <mega@hotpop.com>

	* fixed log for at least 3rd level branches

2003-08-12  Gabor Melis  <mega@hotpop.com>

	* hopefully fixed global update thinking it was only updating some
	of the files

2003-08-11  Gabor Melis  <mega@hotpop.com>

	* common commands such as commit, update, diff and status
	consistently do not include meta files in the operation if
	explicit file arguments are specified and operate on the whole
	module with no file args

	* fixed status handling bug in execute-program-xargs that made
	commit not detect cvs commit failure if not the whole module but
	only some of the files were committed and consequently screwed up
	the VERSION file, as always.

2003-08-10  Gabor Melis  <mega@hotpop.com>

	* when merging invoke cvs update with -rTHISVERSION to avoid
	version changes of files

2003-08-09  Gabor Melis  <mega@hotpop.com>

	* failure of version tagging after commit is logged and no
	subsequent commits and updates are possible until a retag-version

	* Makefile changes

	* test scripts for merge

	* resolve conflict in version file if necessary after merge

2003-08-08  Gabor Melis  <mega@hotpop.com>

	* rtag the newly created branch after commiting the first version,
	so that the first version on a branch can be referenced like others

	* detect locally modified VERSION file on commit/branch and exit
