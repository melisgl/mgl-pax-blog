<p>Catchy title, innit? I came up with it while trying to
name the development style <a href="https://github.com/melisgl/mgl-pax" >PAX</a>
enables. The original idea was something vaguely self-explanatory in
a straight out of a marketing department kind of way, with tendrils
right into your unconscious. Documentation-driven development
sounded just the thing, but it's already taken. Luckily, I came to
realize that neither documentation nor any other single thing should
drive development. Less luckily for the philosophically disinclined,
this epiphany unleashed my inner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_P._Gabriel" >Richard P.
Gabriel</a>. I reckon
if there is a point to what follows, it's abstract enough to make it
hard to tell.</p>
<p>In programming, there is always a formalization step involved: we
must go from idea to code. Very rarely, we have a formal definition
of the problem, but apart from purely theoretical exercises,
formalization always involves a jump of faith. It's like math word
problems: the translation from natural to formal language is out of
the scope of formal methods.</p>
<p>We strive to shorten the jump by looking at the solution carefully
from different angles (code, docs, specs), by poking at it and
observing its behaviour (tests, logs, input-output, debugging).
These facets (descriptive or behavioural) of the solution are
redundant with the code and each other. This redundancy is our main
tool to shorten the jump. Ultimately, some faith will still be
required, but the hope is that if a thing looks good from several
angles and behaves well, then it's likely to be a good solution.
Programming is empirical.</p>
<p>Tests, on the abstract level, have the same primary job as any other
facet: constrain the solution by introducing redundancy. If
automatic, they have useful properties: 1.&nbsp;they are cheap to run;
2.&nbsp;inconsistencies between code and tests are found automatically;
3.&nbsp;they exert pressure to keep the code easily testable (when tracking
test coverage); 4.&nbsp;sometimes it's easiest to start with writing the
tests. On the other hand, tests incur a maintenance cost (often
small compared to the gains).</p>
<p>Unlike tests, documentation is mostly in natural language. This has
the following considerable disadvantages: documentation is expensive
to write and to check (must be read and compared to the
implementation, which involves humans for a short while longer),
consequently, it easily diverges from the code. It seems like the
wrong kind of redundancy. On the positive side, 1.&nbsp;it is valuable
for users (e.g. user manual) and also for the programmer to
understand the intention; 2.&nbsp;it encourages easily explainable
designs; 3.&nbsp;sometimes it's easiest to start with writing the
documentation.</p>
<p>Like tests or any other facet, documentation is not always needed,
it can drive the development process, or it can lag. But it is a
tremendously useful tool to encourage clean design and keep the code
comprehensible.</p>
<p>Writing and maintaining good documentation is costly, but the cost
can vary greatly. Knuth's Literate Programming took the very
opinionated stance of treating documentation of internals as the
primary product, which is a great fit for certain types of problems.
PAX is much more mellow. It does not require a complete overhaul of
the development process or tooling; giving up interactive
development would be too high a price. PAX is chiefly about reducing
the distance between code and its documentation, so that they can be
changed together. By doing so, it reduces the maintenance cost,
improves both the design and the documentation, while making the
code more comprehensible.</p>
<p>In summary,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Multiple, redundant facets are needed to have confidence in a
  solution.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintaining them has a cost.</p></li>
<li><p>This cost shapes the solution.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no universally good set of facets.</p></li>
<li><p>There need not be a primary facet to drive development.</p></li>
<li><p>We mentally switch between facets frequently.</p></li>
<li><p>Our tools should make working with multiple facets easier.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is what PAX tries to do for documentation and code.

And that's the best 4KiB name I could come up with.</p>
